My notes on types of firm

A MiFID optional exemption firm, is exempt from full MiFID and ChatGPT says that this may include "Receiving and transmitting orders without holding client funds or securities". However, ZW may be seen as holding securities, unless perhaps this falls under the smart contract operator which is decentralised or a DAO or DUNA. Exemption may be provided if no retail customers are involved, only pros.

A credit institution accepts deposits, grants loans and credit for its own account, so e.g. banks and building societies.

**Author's Note** -  "Further, MiCA doesn’t cover crypto-assets (or crypto-asset services) that are deemed to be securities in order to prevent a duplication of frameworks. These services around tokenized securities are covered by MiFID and for those who want to trial securities trading and settlement on blockchains, the EU adopted a “DLT pilot regime” that kicked-off officially in March 2023."

**Author's Note** -  There's this "prudential context" which seems to be a broader responsibility to the UK and the industry.

# PRIN Principles for Businesses

The actual principles, with the principles part known as PRIN:

| Principle | Title | Description |
|-----------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | Integrity | A firm must conduct its business with integrity. |
| 2 | Skill, care and diligence | A firm must conduct its business with due skill, care and diligence. |
| 3 | Management and control | A firm must take reasonable care to organise and control its affairs responsibly and effectively, with adequate risk management systems. |
| 4 | Financial prudence | A firm must maintain adequate financial resources. |
| 5 | Market conduct | A firm must observe proper standards of market conduct. |
| 6 | Customers' interests | A firm must pay due regard to the interests of its customers and treat them fairly. |
| 7 | Communications with clients | A firm must pay due regard to the information needs of its clients, and communicate information to them in a way which is clear, fair and not misleading. |
| 8 | Conflicts of interest | A firm must manage conflicts of interest fairly, both between itself and its customers and between a customer and another client. |
| 9 | Customers: relationships of trust | A firm must take reasonable care to ensure the suitability of its advice and discretionary decisions for any customer who is entitled to rely upon its judgment. |
| 10 | Clients' assets | A firm must arrange adequate protection for clients' assets when it is responsible for them. |
| 11 | Relations with regulators | A firm must deal with its regulators in an open and cooperative way, and must disclose to the FCA appropriately anything relating to the firm of which that regulator would reasonably expect notice. |
| 12 | Consumer Duty | A firm must act to deliver good outcomes for retail customers. |
	
	
 - A firm is generally a regulated firm.
 - A person can be a human or a company entity.
 - The Principles are straight forward and reasonable.

https://www.handbook.fca.org.uk/handbook/PRIN/2/1.html#D3

 - 'fit and proper standards' are specified separately for PSR and EMR firms.
 - Other businesses in the firm's group have an impact on adequacy of risk/controls/conduct.
 - Conduct applies to world-wide activities, though depends on standards expected in location/market, duties to its regulator.
 - Breaching a principle brings about liability to disciplinary sanctions.
 - Onus on FCA to find fault, depending on the principle.
 - A client can be treated as eligible counterparty which means they are sophisticated and can look after themselves.
 - A retail customer can be a prospective customer, obviously.

## PRIN 2A
	
PRIN 2A seems focused on principle 12, Consumer Duty and retail customers.
	
 - There's separate guidance on expectations for Consumer Duty: https://www.fca.org.uk/publication/finalised-guidance/fg22-5.pdf
 - If principles 6 and 7 apply, and are breached, likely 12 is breached, but if 6, 7 are in accordance it doesn't mean 12 is in accordance by default.
 - "Acting in good faith is a standard of conduct characterised by honesty, fair and open dealing and acting consistently with the reasonable expectations of retail customers."
 - "PRIN 2A.2.5 does not apply where the harm identified was caused by risks inherent in a product, provided the firm reasonably believed that retail customers or the relevant retail customer (as the context requires) understood and accepted those risks.", presumably this is for trading systems etc.
 - "ensuring all aspects of the design, terms, marketing, sale of and support for its products avoid causing foreseeable harm;".
 - Product may include a mortgage with inherent risks.
	
	Skipped the rest of 2A in search of more relevant stuff.

## PRIN 3
	
PRIN 3 seems to be about to whom the principles apply.

 - Applies to all firms except emissions auctioneers.
 - Also applies to an electronic money institution and an authorised payment institution, a small payment institution, or a registered account information service provider - presumably these are not firms else why enumerate them especially?
 - Principle 7 applies to a registered person communicating a financial promotion for crypto assets.
 - I think  3.1.8 it says the Payments Services Directive, Consumer Credit Directive and Electronic Money Directive have priority over the principles.
 - Bunch of stuff to do with Brexit transition.
 - Quite repetitive/obvious.
 - PRIN 3.3 Where? 
 - Principles 1, 2 and 3, in a prudential context, applies wherever you're doing business but there's some legalese verbiage about wider scopes and onshore regulations.
 - Principle 4, everywhere active.
 - It's repetitive and obvious.
 - PRIN 3.4 General
 - Mentions principle 7 applies in full to MiFID.
 - Mentions treating clients as eligible counterparties again.
 - Contravention of rules in PRIN does not give right of action to a private person, section138D (shit ton of legalese to define a private person).
 - Principle 11 refers to regulators, which means any of them in the world.

## PRIN 4.1

PRIN 4.1 appears to be about MiFID businesses, which is what we care about. It's about how the EU Law takes precedent over FCA in certain circumstances for UK MiFID businesses (the UK's copy pasta of MiFID II).

 - Confusing and nebulous.

 - "Certain requirements" from MiFID don't apply for eligible counterparty business and/or transactions under rules of multilateral trading facility, and/or transactions concluded on a regulated market.

 - Above is for principles 1, 2, 6, 9 and 12.

Claude explains it like so:


Let me clarify - looking at PRIN 4.1.4(3), it's stating that Principles 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10 and 11 are "not limited in this way" - meaning these Principles are not affected by the EU supremacy rule discussed in PRIN 3.1.6 R.

To put it another way:

 - These Principles (3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 10 and 11) aren't subject to the MiFID-related disapplications
 - They apply in full, regardless of whether there might be conflicting EU measures
 - This is in contrast to Principles 1, 2, 6, 9, 12 which can be disapplied where they conflict with EU measures

So it's talking about the rule of EU supremacy - these seven Principles are exempt from having to give way to EU rules, unlike the other Principles which must yield where there's a conflict.

## PRIN TP 1 Transitional Provisions

Section is a table of situational carve-outs for what I assume is Brexit. Each has a time span.

## PRIN Sch 1 Record Keeping Requirements - None

## PRIN Sch 2 Notification Requirements

Very short section, a table, on principle 11 which simply lists "Anything relating to the firm of which the appropriate regulator would reasonably expect notice"

## PRIN Sch 3 Fees and Other Required Payments - None

## PRIN Sch 4 Powers Exercised - Two deleted sections, not visible.

## PRIN Sch 5 Rights of Action for Damages

Bizarre section that really just says the FCA has removed the right of action for all rules in PRIN.

## PRIN Sch 6 Rules That Can Be Waived

FCA can waive all its rules other than those mase under sections 137O, 247, 248, 261I, 261J.


# SYSC Senior Management Arrangements, Systems and Controls

SYSC is the Systems and Controls, but the handbook neglects to actually explain this.

## SYSC 1.1A Application

Summary of application (details found in each chapter).

 - The first part lists chapter numbers applicable to various types of firm, though only specifies them for Insurer, UK ISPV, Managing agent, Society, Any other SMCR firm and "Every other firm".

 - Every over firm having the following chapters: 4 - 12, 15A, 18, 19D, 19F, 19G, 21, 22, 28, 28A.

 - Next section is a small table for firms that are not PRA-authorised.

 - Chapter 15A applies to electronic money institution, payment institution, registered account information service provider, and also UK RIE.

 - Provisions in SYSC should be read in conjunction with GEN 2.2.23 R to GEN 2.2.25 G, in particular:

   - Both FCA and PRA rules may be applied to PRA-authorised persons.

   - For Solvency II firms there's a note about a bunch of chapters not being inconsistent with PRA rules for Solvency II Directive, or the Solvency II Regulation or EIOPA guidelines from 2015.

	This 1.1A.2 is about Solvency II firms.

## SYSC 1.2 Purpose

Taken verbatim because it's a rare readable part:

(1) 
to encourage firms' directors and senior managers to take appropriate practical responsibility for their firms' arrangements on matters likely to be of interest to the FCA because they impinge on the FCA’s functions under the Act;

(2) 
to increase certainty by amplifying Principle 3, under which a firm must take reasonable care to organise and control its affairs responsibly and effectively, with adequate risk management systems;

(3) 
to encourage firms to vest responsibility for effective and responsible organisation in specific directors and senior managers; and

(4) 
to create a common platform of organisational and systems and controls requirements for all firms.

## SYSC 1.4 Application of SYSC 11 to 28A

Interesting parts:

 - SYSC 12 and 21 don't apply to auction regulation bidding (emissions trading) and some other exceptions for this type.

## SYSC 1.5 Significant SYSC Firm

 - Defines what makes a firm a "significant SYSC firm"

 - Affects governance requirements around directorship limits, nomination committees, and risk committees

 - Impacts whether a firm is considered "enhanced scope" for senior managers regime

 - MIFIDPRU firms have separate requirements

 - Qualification Criteria (any one of):
   - Total assets > £530m
   - Total liabilities > £380m
   - Annual fees/commission income > £160m
   - Client money held > £425m
   - Client assets held > £7.8bn

 - And rules around firms likely to meet this, and those "exiting".

## SYSC 1 Annexes

This section is many pages of long, long tables and is impossible to read. It is pure spaghetti so I have enlisted Google Gemini since it is too long for Claude.

### Google Gemini

Okay, let's break down SYSC 1 Annex 1 of the FCA Handbook. This section is crucial because it defines who the SYSC rules apply to, what activities they apply to, and where they apply. It also specifies which rules are applicable to different types of firms.

#### Key Concepts

 - SYSC: This refers to the Systems and Controls sourcebook of the FCA Handbook. It sets out the organizational and operational requirements for firms.
 - Common Platform Requirements: These are a set of core requirements (SYSC 4-10) that apply to most firms, with some variations.
 - Insurers, UK ISPVs, Managing Agents, and the Society: These are specific types of firms that are generally excluded from the common platform requirements and instead have their own specific rules (SYSC 2 and 3).
 - MiFID: Markets in Financial Instruments Directive. This is a key piece of EU legislation that has been transposed into UK law.
 - MiFID Org Regulation: This is a regulation that sets out detailed organizational requirements for firms subject to MiFID.
 - AIFM: Alternative Investment Fund Manager.
 - UCITS: Undertakings for Collective Investment in Transferable Securities.
 - Prudential Context: This refers to the financial soundness and stability of a firm.
 - Regulated Activities: These are activities that require authorization by the FCA.
 - Ancillary Activities: These are activities that are related to regulated activities.
 - Financial Promotions: These are communications that invite or induce someone to engage in investment activity.
 - UK Domestic Firm: A firm that is incorporated in the UK.
 - Overseas Firm: A firm that is incorporated outside the UK.
 - Third Country Firm: A firm that is incorporated outside the UK and the EU.
 - MIFIDPRU Investment Firm: A firm subject to the prudential requirements in the MIFIDPRU sourcebook.
 - CRR Firm: A firm subject to the Capital Requirements Regulation.
 - Electronic System in Relation to Lending: A system that facilitates lending.
 - Money Laundering Regulations: UK regulations aimed at preventing money laundering and terrorist financing.

#### Part 1: Application of SYSC 2 and SYSC 3

 - Who: SYSC 2 and 3 primarily apply to insurers, UK ISPVs, managing agents, and the Society of Lloyd's.
   - Sole Traders: SYSC 2 applies to sole traders only if they employ someone who needs FCA approval. SYSC 3.2.6I R does not apply to sole traders with no employees.
   - Benchmark Activities: SYSC 2 and 3 generally do not apply to benchmark activities, except for firms that have permission to administer a specified benchmark.
 - What: SYSC 2 and 3 apply to:
   - Regulated activities.
   - Dealing in investments as principal (with a specific exclusion).
   - Ancillary activities related to designated investment business, home finance, and insurance distribution.
   - Activities directly arising from insurance risk transformation.
   - Financial promotions.
   - Unregulated activities in a prudential context.
   - The activities of other members of a firm's group.
   - Important Exceptions: SYSC 3.3 only applies to insurance distribution activities. SYSC 3.2.6A R to SYSC 3.2.6J G do not apply to a wide range of activities, including general insurance, insurance distribution for general insurance and pure protection contracts, long-term insurance outside Solvency II, certain contracts of insurance, Lloyd's activities, home finance, reversion activity, pure reinsurers, and activities directly arising from insurance risk transformation.
 - Where: SYSC 2 and 3 apply to activities carried on from a UK establishment. They also apply in a prudential context to UK domestic firms and overseas firms, regardless of where the activities are carried on.
 - Actions for Damages: A breach of SYSC 2 or 3 does not give rise to a private right of action for damages.

#### Part 2: Application of the Common Platform Requirements (SYSC 4 to 10)

 - Who: The common platform requirements apply to all firms except insurers, UK ISPVs, managing agents, and the Society (unless otherwise specified).
   - Sole Traders: SYSC 4.3 does not apply to sole traders without employees requiring FCA approval. SYSC 4.1.4 R and SYSC 6.3.9 R do not apply to sole traders with no employees.
   - UCITS and AIFM Qualifiers: SYSC 4.3 does not apply to these firms.
   - Authorised Professional Firms: Certain financial crime, conflicts of interest, and Chinese wall requirements do not apply to these firms when carrying on non-mainstream regulated activities.
   - Firms Supervised by Professional Bodies: The financial crime requirements do not apply to firms supervised by professional bodies for money laundering purposes.
   - Full-Scope UK AIFMs of Unauthorised AIFs: These firms have a limited application of the common platform requirements.
   - Benchmark Activities: The common platform requirements generally do not apply to benchmark activities, except for firms that have permission to administer a specified benchmark.
 - What: The common platform requirements apply to:
   - Regulated activities.
   - Dealing in investments as principal (with a specific exclusion).
   - Ancillary activities.
   - Ancillary services related to MiFID business.
   - Collective portfolio management.
   - Financial promotions.
   - Unregulated activities in a prudential context.
   - The activities of other members of a firm's group.
   - MiFID Org Regulation: Certain articles of the MiFID Org Regulation apply to firms' non-MiFID business as if they were rules.
   - Record-Keeping: Record-keeping requirements apply to ancillary activities related to designated investment business, home finance, insurance distribution, credit-related regulated activity, and regulated pensions dashboard activity.
   - Financial Crime: The financial crime requirements do not apply to a wide range of activities, including dealing as principal, ancillary activities, general insurance, insurance distribution for general insurance and pure protection contracts, long-term insurance outside Solvency II, certain contracts of insurance, Lloyd's activities, home finance, reversion activity, meeting of repayment claims, managing dormant asset funds, and regulated funeral plan activities.
   - Money Laundering Regulations: SYSC 6.3 only applies to firms subject to the Money Laundering Regulations.
 - Where: The common platform requirements apply to activities carried on from a UK establishment, except for regulated claims management activities and ancillary activities, which are based on where the activity is carried on (Great Britain). They also apply in a prudential context to UK domestic firms and overseas firms, regardless of where the activities are carried on.
 - Actions for Damages: A breach of the common platform requirements does not give rise to a private right of action for damages.

#### Part 3: Tables Summarising the Application of the Common Platform Requirements

This section provides tables that detail how the common platform requirements apply to different types of firms. The key categories are:
 - Common Platform Firm: These firms have the most comprehensive application of the common platform requirements (Column A).
 - Management Company: These firms have a slightly modified application of the common platform requirements (Column A+).
 - Full-Scope UK AIFM of an Authorised AIF: These firms have a specific application of the common platform requirements (Column A++).
 - MiFID Optional Exemption Firm and Third Country Firm: These firms have a modified application of the common platform requirements, with some rules being treated as guidance (Table B and C).
 - All Other Firms: These firms have a more proportionate application of the common platform requirements, with many rules being treated as guidance (Column B).

#### Key Takeaways

 - Complexity: The application of SYSC is complex and depends heavily on the type of firm and the activities it undertakes.
 - Exclusions: Insurers, UK ISPVs, managing agents, and the Society are generally excluded from the common platform requirements.
 - Proportionality: The rules are applied proportionately, taking into account the nature, scale, and complexity of a firm's business.
 - MiFID Influence: MiFID and the MiFID Org Regulation have a significant impact on the application of the common platform requirements.
 - Prudential Context: The rules have a wider territorial scope when applied in a prudential context.
 - No Private Right of Action: Breaches of SYSC rules do not give rise to a private right of action for damages.

#### In Simple Terms

 - SYSC 2 & 3: These are the rules for the big insurance players and Lloyd's.
 - SYSC 4-10: These are the rules for everyone else, but with different levels of strictness depending on the type of firm.
 - MiFID: This adds extra rules for firms dealing with investments.
 - Where: The rules generally apply to UK activities, but can have a wider reach for financial stability reasons.
Important Note: This is a high-level summary. The actual application of these rules is very detailed and requires careful consideration of the specific circumstances of each firm. You should always refer to the full text of the FCA Handbook for complete and accurate information.

End of Gemini

The common platform requirements are:

(1) SYSC 4 to SYSC 10; and
(2) those articles of the MiFID Org Regulation as applied in accordance with SYSC 1 Annex 1 2.8AR , SYSC 1 Annex 1 3.2-AR, SYSC 1 Annex 1 3.2-BR, SYSC 1 Annex 1 3.2CR and SYSC 1 Annex 1 3.3R.

## SYSC 2.1 Apportionment of Responsibilities

So here we are in the meat of the Systems and Controls for the FCA.

 - Reasonable care to "apportion" significant responsibilities among directors and senior managers such that it is clear who has them, and the business  can be adequately monitored and controlled

 - Consider additional guidance in SYSC 21.

 - The non-executive director will vary (a director who has no responsibility for implementing the decisions or the policies of the governing body of a firm.) I'm not sure what the point of this part is.

 - Note about insurance distribution activities.

## SYSC 2.2 Recording the Apportionment

 - Keep records up to date, keep for 6 years.

 - Note about Solvency II firms.

 - Org charts, project docs etc. and record changes ASAP.

 - Be clear about single responsibilities shared by people.

## SYSC 3.1 Systems and Controls

 - A firm must take reasonable care to establish and maintain such systems and controls as are appropriate to its business, the nature and extent depending on:

   - Nature, scale and complexity of business.
   - Diversity of operations.
   - Volume and size of transactions.
   - Degree of risk in each area of ops.

 - Regular reviews.

 - Areas typically covered are in SYSC 3.2 with details elsewhere in the handbook.

 - Consider guidance on risk-centric governance in SYSC 21.

 - Due credit given for following UK Corporate Governance Code where relevant, see https://www.frc.org.uk/directors/corporate-governance-and-stewardship/uk-corporate-governance-code

 - A firm has specific responsibilities regarding its appointed representatives or where applicable its tied agents, see SUP 12.

 - SYSC 2.1.3 R (2) prescribes how a firm <mark>must allocate the function of overseeing the establishment and maintenance of systems and controls</mark> described in SYSC 3.1.1 R.

	This is the first, specific rule, I've read.

 - SYSC 3.1.6 to 10 incl. defines the Competent Employees Rule. A firm must employ personnel with the skills, knowledge and expertise necessary.

 - Take into account the nature, scale and complexity of its business, and services offered, etc. Obvious stuff.

 - SYSC 28 contains rules and guidance relating to the minimum knowledge and competence requirements for insurance distribution activities.

 - The Training and Competence Sourcebook (TC) contains further rules and guidance for retail activities, but even (I think it means non-retail firms) may wish to consider them.

 - If a firm requires employees who are not subject to a <mark>qualification requirement in TC</mark> to pass a relevant examination from the list of appropriate qualifications maintained by the FCA, the appropriate regulator will take that into account when assessing whether the firm has ensured that the employee satisfies the knowledge component of the competent employees rule.

	Basically, over-qualifying/training will help you.

 - Note about insurance.

## SYSC 3.2 Areas Covered by Systems and Controls

Main issues which a firm is expected to consider.

 - Organisation

   - Clear reporting lines, responsibilities, communicated.

   - Where a governing body delegates functions and tasks to either employees, appointed representatives, or its tied agents, safeguards should be put in place. Assess delegate's suitability given responsibility. Make extent/limits clear. Monitor. Concerns followed up.

   - Also applies externally; cannot contract out regulatory obligations.

   - Larger firms should segregate duties to reduce financial crime, regs breaches, e.g. front and back office, no single person can control the full transaction.

 - System and controls in relation to compliance, financial crime and money laundering

   - Care; systems and controls for countering risk that the firm used to further financial crime.

   - Systems must identify, assess, monitor, manage money laundering risk, and proportionate to scale, nature, complexity of business.

   - Regular reviews of adequacy and compliance.

   - May also have separate obligations to comply with e.g. Terrorism Act 2000, Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 and MLR. Carve out for these is mentioned.

   - Consider guidance issued by Join Money Laundering Steering Group.

   - Should consider its customer, product and activity profiles, distribution channels, complexity and volume of transactions, processes and systems, and operating environment.

   - Ensure systems include MLR training, <mark>annual report from MLRO (officer) to the board and management on systems and controls</mark>. Docs of risk management policies, risk profile in regard to MLR, documentation of application of policies. Measures to ensure MLR risk considered during development of new products, new customers, change in its business profile, <mark>and yet measures to ensure new customer ID checks don't unreasonable deny access to services for those who cannot be expected to produce detailed evidence of identity!</mark>

   - <mark>Must allocate to director or senior manager (who may be the MLRO) overall responsibility for establishment and maintenance of anti-MLR systems and controls.</mark>

 - The money laundering reporting officer (MLRO)

   - A firm <mark>must appoint an individual MLRO to oversee compliance with all MLR stuff</mark>, and must have authority and independence and information access.

   - The MLRO is <mark>expected to be UK based</mark>, focal point for all MLR stuff.

 - Financial crime guidance

   - See Financial Crime Guide: A firm’s guide to countering financial crime risks, and Financial Crime Thematic Reviews.

 - The compliance function

   - Depending on nature/scale/complexity, separate out compliance function. Document responsibilities, give authority, information, access to board.

   - <mark>Must allocate to a director or senior manager the function of oversight of compliance, and reporting to governing body/board</mark>.

   - Compliance means compliance with regulatory system under FCA ("FCA compliance").

 - Note about Lloyd's firms.

 - Risk assessment

   - Nature/scale/complexity, may want a separate risk assessment function, documented, resourced well, competent, independent.

   - Talks about this being about common concept of risk assessment, then seems to allude to controlling risk exposure, i.e. market risk, <mark>may fall under PRA chief risk officer controlled function</mark>.

   - Specifics mentioned for Solvency II firms.

 - Management information

   - The board must have good information with which to manage risk of regulatory concern; relevant, reliable, timely.

   - Risks of regulatory concern relate to fair treatment of customers, consumer protection, "effective competition" and integrity of UK financial system (soundness, stability, resilience) and use of system wrt financial crime.

 - Employees and agents

   - Systems and controls should assess suitability of anyone who acts for it.

   - Talks about assessing honesty.

   - <mark>Part V of the Act (Performance of Regulated Activities) and SUP 10C and the Senior Insurance Management Function parts of PRA Rulebook specify requirements wrt approved persons</mark>.

 - Audit committee

   - Nature/scale/complexity: may form an audit committee to examine management's process for ensuring the appropriateness and effectiveness of systems and controls, oversee internal audit functions (if applicable) and interface with external auditors. Should have appropriate number of non-executive directors and form terms of reference.

 - Internal audit

   - Nature/scale/complexity: reports to the above audit committee or senior manager, independent of day-to-day activities, access to records.

   - This function is not an FCA controlled function itself, but may fall under PRA chief risk officer controlled function.

   - Carve out for Solvency II firms.

 - Business strategy

   - Plan so it can identify, measure, manage and control risk of regulatory concern. Maybe be appropriate to have business plans or strategy plans documented and updated on regular basis to account for changes in business environment.

 - Renumeration policies

   - Manage tensions between ability for firm meet requirements and standards and personal advantage of those who act for it. Mentions Solvency II and EIOPA.

 - Business continuity

   - Nature/scale/complexity: BCP provision, updated and tested. Solvency II firms have own requirements in PRA Rulebook.

 - Records

   - Record matters and dealings, accounts. Must be capable of being reproduced in English on paper, unless from activity outside UK, then can use their language.

   - Records must be adequate, accessible, retained for correct time, secure. "The general principle is that records should be retained for as long as is relevant for the purposes for which they are made."

   - SYSC 28 has rules and guidance re. knowledge and competence records, re. insurance distribution activities.

   - Details per firm type are elsewhere in the handbook.

 - Investment strategy and investment decision making

   - Part about ESG and investments and principles, policyholder returns, all N/A to my needs.

 - Operators of pensions dashboard services: security, integrity and confidentiality

   - N/A

## SYSC 3.3 Additional Requirements for Insurance Distribution, and

## SYSC 3.4 SRD Requirements

Applies to insurers and is not applicable.

## SYSC 4.1 General Requirements

**Author's Note** -  ESMA Regulation guidelines exist for MiFID, see http://www.esma.europa.eu/content/Guidelines-certain-aspects-MiFID-compliance-function-requirements

 - Application to a common platform firm:

   - The MiFID Org Regulation applies.

 - Application to a MiFID optional exemption firm and to a third country firm

   - Yes, applies, as does MiFID Org Regulation

 - General requirements

   - <mark>Must have robust governance arrangements, clear org structure, well defined, transparent and consistent lines of responsibility, effective processes to identify, manage, monitor and report the risks it is or might be exposed to, and internal control mechanisms, including sound administrative and accounting procedures and effective control and safeguard arrangements for information processing systems</mark>.

   - Must good security for the transfer of information, mitigating data loss and unauthorised access, and leakage, while not obstructing any competent authority e.g. FCA access.

   - Additional stuff for fund managers and UCITS (collective investments).

   - For common platform firm, nature/scale/complexity, must be comprehensive, and take in specific technical criteria in article 21(3) or MiFID Org Regulation and whichever of the following:

     - SYSC 19B for full-scope UK AIFM
     - SYSC 19D, where applicable
     - PRA Rulebook remuneration part, where applicable
     - SYSC 19G, where applicable

   - Note saying that for other firms, the comprehensiveness and proportionality rule above is to be treated as guidance.

   - Notes for management company or full-scope UK AIFM.

 - Resources for management companies and AIFMs

	Not applicable

 - Subordinate measures…

	Not applicable

 - Mechanisms and procedures for a firm

   - A firm, except a common platform firm and a sole trader (not applicable), nature/scale/complexity, must:

     - For a management company (investments), establish, implement and maintain decision-making procedures and clear org structure with reporting lines, etc. etc.

     - Maintain adequate internal control mechanisms to secure compliance with decisions, procedures at all levels of the firm.

     - Maintain internal reporting and comms at all levels, and

     - If a management company, maintain effective reporting and comms, all levels, and information flows with an third party
	
	My own **Author's Note** -  it's really vague, doesn't really say anything other than be a fucking pro about things.

 - Operators of pensions dashboard services: security, integrity and confidentiality

Not applicable

 - Business continuity

   - A common platform firm must take reasonable steps to make sure shit works all the time.

   - A CRR firm and a management company must also limit losses, not lose data, etc.

   - For other firms this is guidance "should" not "must".

   - BCP includes people, systems, operations recovery priorities, comms including internal and external and FCA and clients and press.

   - Escalation and invocation plans, contact info.

   - Processes to check integrity of information affected by outage, and

   - Regular testing of it all.

 - Operators of electronic systems in relation to lending: arrangements to administer loans in the event of platform failure

   - It reads as if the loans should continue to be managed according to their terms, if the operator "fails" which I read as technically, but I think it means financially. It specificially talks about P2P agreements, but also non-P2P in the same portfolio. Perhaps it means keeping money aside to manually deal with the loans, even if the companies fails, or perhaps find some other company to take the business on?!

   - I guess the "administrators" do this.

   - Administrators must deal with each loan or customer equally.

   - Okay then it goes on to mention finding another firm to help. And get consent from lender clients to fund any cost of administration of the loan, fees, and consent from both parties to transfer the loans to the other firm.

   - It does indeed say about holding ring-fenced money to administer loans during administration.

   - And to continually be thinking about this ring-fenced amount wrt the loan portfolio.

   - Seek professional advice on its plan from insolvency experts on whether provisions, ring-fenced money is good enough, especially:

     - Terms in contracts are enforceable.
     - Practical obstacles, including having enough money ring-fenced.
     - Ancillary activities.
     - Fair for customers, doesn't favor non-P2P.
     - Account for tax for lender clients.

   - Reminder about disclosure requirements in COBS 18.12.28R and WDPG, Wind Down Planning Guide.

   - Write to FCA is contemplating ceasing to manage P2P agreements, or implementing arrangements above, or similar arrangements.

   - An operator of an electronic system in relation to lending must keep an up-to-date P2P resolution manual which is like a BCP plan for the business loan side, and must address:
	
     - How it operates normally, day-to-day, people and resources, critical staff, premises, IT systems, data storage and recovery, record-keeping systems and organisation, bank accounts and payments facilities, persons outside the firm (note persons also means companies, outsourcers), legal docs and contracts, structure chart of firm's group with owners and geo, holding of "security" for loans.

   - Steps to manage loans by an administrator, critical loan terms, and how the firm's systems can produce the detail specified in COBS 18.12.31R Ongoing Disclosures for each P2P agreement facilitated by it.

   - Must ensure P2P resolution manual would be immediately available to an administrator, receiver, trustee, liquidator or similar officer and the FCA, on request.

   - And it must be stored in the same place as its CASS resolution pack, if CASS 10 applies.

 - Operators of electronic systems in relation to lending: title transfer

   - Must not accept, take or receive the transfer of full ownership of money relating to P2P agreements. The following is from Claude:

   - If the operator has made a client money election (which is a formal declaration about how they'll handle client funds) AND they are operating an electronic system for non-P2P agreements (lending arrangements that don't involve peer-to-peer lending) THEN they must not accept or take full ownership of any money related to these non-P2P agreements.

   - In simpler terms, this rule prevents lending platforms that have opted into certain client money protections from taking ownership of funds related to non-P2P lending activities. This is likely designed to protect client funds by ensuring they remain separate from the operator's own assets.

	 A "client money election" under CASS 7.10.7AR is a specific regulatory choice that firms can make regarding how they handle client money.
     
     When a firm makes a client money election, they are essentially opting to treat certain funds as "client money" under the FCA's Client Assets Sourcebook (CASS) rules. This means the money will be subject to strict regulatory protections and requirements designed to safeguard client assets.
	
 - Accounting policies: management company

   - Means investment management, units, funds, portfolios etc.

   - Must have processes to make financial reports (in a "timely manner") which reflect a true and fair view of its financial position and which comply with all applicable accounting standards and rules, on FCA request.

 - Regular monitoring: management company

   - Systems and controls must be frequently reviewed.

 - Regular monitoring: other firms

   - Above applies as guidance.

 - Audit committee

   - Nature/scale/complexity: perhaps form an audit committee.

 - Risk control: additional guidance

   - All firms should consider additional guidance on risk-centric governance, in SYSC 21.

 - Apportionment of responsibilities: the role of the non-executive director

   - "The role undertaken by a non-executive director will vary from one firm to another." - literally that's all it says.

 - Investment strategy and investment decision making of an operator of a personal pension scheme of stakeholder pension scheme

   - How to think about ESG financial considerations, and other financials considerations and non-financial matters as part of its investment strategy or decision making to demonstrate compliance with princinples 2, 3, 6 or 8.

   - Not applicable to my business.

## SYSC 4.2 Persons who effectively direct the business

 - General requirement

   - The senior personnel of a common platform firm, a management company, a full-scope UK AIFM, or of the UK branch of a non-UK bank <mark>must be of sufficiently good repute and sufficiently experience as to ensure the sound and prudent management of the firm</mark>.

   - A common platform firm means a MiFIDPRU investment firm, or a bank, or a building society, or a designated investment firm, or a dormant asset fund operator.

   - <mark>Other firms should take account of the senior personnel rule SYSC 4.2.1 R as if guidance ("should" over "must")</mark>.

 - Responsibility of senior personnel of an AIFM

   - Not applicable

 - Composition of management

   - The senior personnel of a common platform firm, a management company, a full-scope UK AIFM, or of the UK branch of a non-UK bank must have at least two people meeting requirements, this is not applicable.

   - For a body corporate, the persons re. 4.2.2 R should be either executive directors or persons granted execute powers by and reporting immediately to the governing body, or active partners if a partnership. A "body corporate" is like a limited company, so this <mark>is applicable</mark>.

   - At least two independent minds should be applied to the formulation and implementation of the policies of a common platform firm, a management company, a full-scope UK AIFM and the UK branch of a third country firm. So this is not applicable.

 - Alternative arrangements

   - This reads as if a common platform firm may be a single person, sole trader or something.

   - <mark>It must have "alternative arrangements" in place which ensure sound and prudent management of the firm</mark>.

I don’t think this is applicable because ZW would not be a common platform firm, but in any case I think it is saying that a single person should bring in external help and audit and expertise, succession planning and sickness cover.

## SYSC 4.3 Responsibility of senior personnel

 - A firm (with the exception of a common platform firm and a sole trader who does not employ any person who is required to be approved under section 59 of the Act (Approval for particular arrangements)), <mark>when allocating functions internally, must ensure that senior personnel and, where appropriate, the supervisory function, are responsible for ensuring that the firm complies with its obligations under the regulatory system. In particular, senior personnel and, where appropriate, the supervisory function must assess and periodically review the effectiveness of the policies, arrangements and procedures put in place to comply with the firm's obligations under the regulatory system and take appropriate measures to address any deficiencies</mark>.

   In a sense, they must be a kind of internal audit. The "supervisory function" relates to a function in a common platform firm, management company, or electronic system in relation to lending, which sounds not applicable.

 - Further notes pertaining to management company and operator of an electronic system in relation to lending, likely not applicable, see SYSC 4.3.2 R, about <mark>frequent, at least annual written reports</mark>.

 - Other firms should take account of the written reports as guidance.

 - The supervisory function does not include a general meeting of the shareholders of a firm, or equivalent bodies, but could involve, for example, a separate supervisory board within a two-tier board structure or the establishment of a non-executive committee of a single-tier board structure. Not applicable.

## SYSC 4.3 A Management body and nomination committee

 - Section seems only to apply to a common platform firm and its management body.
	
 - Interesting note:

A firm may wish to use the <mark>“Template for a matrix to assess the collective competence of members of the management body”</mark> in Annex I of the joint ESMA and EBA publication titled “Guidelines on the assessment of the suitability of members of the management body and key function holders under Directive 2013/36/EU and Directive 2014/65/EU” when assessing collective competence.

## SYSC 4.4 Apportionment of responsibilities

 - Application

   - Section applies to a complex set of firms, which Claude thinks could be most smaller regulated firms. "SMCR firms" seem to be the broad category for most regulated firms.

   - Mentions a flow chart of firm types, here: https://www.handbook.fca.org.uk/handbook/SYSC/23/Annex1.html?date=2025-01-22#D26

 - Maintaining a clear and appropriate apportionment

   - Must take reasonable case to apportion significant responsibilities in a way so it's clear, affords monitoring and control.

 - Allocating functions of apportionment and oversight

   - Must allocate to one or more individuals, the functions of (1) dealing with apportionment of responsibilities under 4.4.3 R, and (2) overseeing systems and controls under 4.1.1 R, according to the table:

     - The first row concerns firms in a group, not applicable.
     - The second row concerns EEA SMCR firm, allocation of the functions 1 and 2 above to directors and senior managers.
     - The last row is for any other firm and both functions to the CEO(s) jointly else, directors and senior managers.

   - Author's **Author's Note** -  it's bizarrely convoluted way to express things. There's a long FAQ table underneath it.

   - Claude says:

		Main Requirements:

        - Organizations must assign two key functions to specific individuals: 
        - Apportioning responsibilities
        - Overseeing systems and controls
    
        Who Can Be Assigned:

	   - For most firms, these functions must be assigned to the Chief Executive (CEO)
	   - If there's no CEO, or in addition to the CEO, the functions can be assigned to: 

		   - Directors
		   - Senior managers
		   - For group companies, a director/senior manager responsible for the group or division

		Key Points:

	   - These individuals must be approved persons (officially approved for their role)
	   - Functions can be shared between multiple people if appropriate
	   - For most firms, having 1-2 people responsible is considered appropriate
	   - A Chief Executive can be someone with an equivalent title (like Managing Director)
	   - For international firms, the requirements apply to UK operations
	   - The allocation should support compliance with core principles and controls

		Special Cases:

	   - If a firm has a management committee, functions can be allocated to all members
	   - For partnerships, most partners would typically qualify as directors or senior managers
	   - In some cases, good corporate governance might require the CEO to not be involved in certain aspects (like audit committees)
	   - Different rules apply for EEA firms (European Economic Area) operating in the UK

	The rest of the section is missing or deleted.

## SYSC 5.1 Skills, knowledge and expertise

ESMA has also issued guidelines under article 16(3) of the ESMA Regulation covering certain aspects of the MiFID compliance function requirements. See  http://www.esma.europa.eu/content/Guidelines-certain-aspects-MiFID-compliance-function-requirements

 - Application to a common platform firm

Not applicable

 - Application to a MiFID optional exemption firm and to a third country firm

	Not applicable

 - Competent employees rule

   - <mark>Basically: hire properly.</mark>

   - Skill/knowledge/expertise: a firm (not common platform firm) must employ capable personnel.

   - A firm's systems and controls should "enable it to satisfy itself of the suitability of anyone who acts for it", including assessing honesty and competence, usually during recruitment, honesty reviewed if justified.

   - Consider level of responsibility, obvious stuff.

   - Note about SYSC 28 and insurance.

   - <mark>The Training and Competence sourcebook (TC) contains additional rules and guidance relating to specified retail activities undertaken by a firm.</mark>

   - <mark>"The requirements on firms with respect to approved persons are in Part V of the Act (Performance of regulated activities) and SUP 10A, SUP 10C and in the corresponding parts of the PRA’s Rulebook."</mark> - "approved persons" are those with controlled functions.

   - Controlled functions are listed here: https://www.handbook.fca.org.uk/handbook/SUP/10C/4.html?date=2025-01-22#D83, and https://www.handbook.fca.org.uk/handbook/SUP/10A/4.html?date=2025-01-22#DES95, and Senior Management Functions under PRA Rulebook.

   - If a firm requires employees who are not subject to a qualification requirement in TC to pass a relevant examination from the list of appropriate qualifications maintained by the FCA, or for the purposes of meeting its obligations under SYSC 5.1.5ABR, the FCA will take that into account when assessing whether the firm has ensured that the employee satisfies the knowledge component of the competent employees rule.

I think it's saying the FCA likes over-skilling people.

 - Knowledge and competence

   - SYSC 5.1.5AA regards a common platform firm and third country firm, so not applicable. It's saying firms must prove to the FCA if asked that people are skilled and there's an ESMA guide for this.

   - Talks about nature/scale/complexity vs. competence.

 - Segregation of functions

   - 5.1.6 R Applies to a management company and considering conflicts of duty for people wearing more than one hat.

   - 5.1.7 R is for common platform company and is about conflict of interest.

   - Other firms should take account of segregation rules SYSC 5.1.6 R and 7 R, above.

   - It's obvious stuff, it barely really says anyting, "ensure that no one individual is completely free to commit a firm's assets or incur liabilities on its behalf" - I guess if you've never worked in a regulated company this might be news.

 - Segregation of functions: additional guidance

   - Should ensure no single individual has unrestricted authority to do all of the following:

	   - Initiate a transaction
	   - "bind" the firm
	   - make payments, and
	   - "account for it"

   - Companies with limited staff should add compensating controls, reviews by others.

   - Any outsourced people performing internal audit should be independent from those doing external audit.

 - Awareness of procedures: management company

   - A management company must ensure people follow procedure.

 - Awareness of procedures: other firms

   - For other firms this is a "should" (weirdly obvious, and weird that they only "should" be aware of procedures).

 - General

   - Nature/scale/complexity, range of services wrt to above.

   - Management company must monitor, regularly review, fix, procedures etc. but for other firms, monitoring/review of systems is guidance.

## SYSC 6.1 Compliance


ESMA has also issued guidelines under article 16(3) of the ESMA Regulation covering certain aspects of the MiFID compliance function requirements. See https://www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/library/esma35-36-1946_final_report_guidelines_on_certain_aspects_of_the_mifid_ii_compliance_function.pdf
 - Application to a common platform firm

   - Not applicable

 - Application to a MiFID optional exemption firm and to a third country firm

   > (1) the rules and guidance in this chapter apply to them as if they were rules or as guidance in accordance with SYSC 1 Annex 1 3.2CR(1); and (2) those articles of the MiFID Org Regulation in SYSC 1 Annex 1 2.8AR and 3.2CR apply to them as if they were rules or as guidance in accordance with SYSC 1 Annex 1 3.2CR(2).

 - Adequacy policy and procedures

   - A firm must have policies and procedures for its managers, employees, appointed representatives and any tied agents for its regulatory obligations and prevention of financial crime.

   - Nature/scale/complexity, range of services, a management firm or operator of electronic system in relation to lending must have procedures to detect any risk of failure to comply and to minimise such risk and to enable to FCA to "exercise its powers".

   - The above is guidance for other firms.

 - Compliance function

   - A management company or operator of an electronic system in relation to lending must have a permanent compliance function to monitor and assess everything, advise and assist on compliance.

   - For other firms the above is guidance but consider nature/scale/complexity.

   - Further notes for compliance for management company or operator of an electronic system in relation to lending in 6.1.4 R.

   - May need to consider dual-regulated firms Remuneration Code, and/or "remuneration part" of PRA Rulebook, and/or MiFIDPRU Remuneration Code.

   - SYSC 6.1.4A a firm which is not a common platform firm or management company and which carries on <mark>designated investment business</mark> or for retails client of professional clients must allocate to a director or senior manager the function of:

	   - Overseeing compliance and
	   - Reporting compliance matters to board

   - And this means compliance with rules in COBS (Conduct of Business sourcebook), COLL (Collective Investment Schemes sourcebook), CASS (Client Assets sourcebook) and ICOBS (Insurance: Conduct of Business sourcebook).

   - Full-scope UK AIFMs need to comply with AIFM Remuneration Code.

   - A <mark>debt management firm</mark> and credit repair firm or Class 1 as per CMCOB 7.2.5R(1) and SUP 10C (FCA senior managers regime for approved persons in SMCR firms) <mark>must appoint a compliance officer</mark>.

I think this this is companies that do IVAs and bankruptcies.

   - "(3) In the FCA's view, it will be appropriate, in many cases, for the removal or any other disciplinary sanctioning of the compliance officer to require the approval of a majority of the management body, including at least a majority of its members who do not perform any executive function in the firm."

   - <mark>SYSC 6.1.5 then caveats all of this with nature/scale/complexity consideration</mark> except if you're doing P2P lending with a "target rate" then you need a compliance officer.

## SYSC 6.2 Internal audit

 - Repeats stuff way above about having a discreet IA for large/complex enough management company or operator of an electronic system in relation to lending.

 - Repeats what IA do.

 - Guidance for everyone else.

 - Mentions firms required to have IA under article 24 of MiFID Org Regulation.

 - Mentions the firing of IA head and independence of IA and same note about disciplinary as for compliance person, above.

 - Mentions internal audit being a function of assessing adherence to systems and controls, effectiveness of them etc.

 - SYSC 6.2.2 G (3) For an SMCR firm that is a PRA-authorised person,the internal audit function is a PRA controlled function (SMF5). For an enhanced scope SMCR firm it is an FCA controlled function (SMF5).

## SYSC 6.3 Financial crime

 - Nature/scale/complexity: a firm must have policies/procedures, systems/controls to spot, assess, monitor, manage money laundering risk, these must be regularly reviewed etc. etc.

 - A firm may also need to comply with the Terrorism Act 2000, and/or the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, and Money Laundering Regulation.

 - Firms should follow ML guidance issued by Joint Money Laundering Steering Group.

 - Firms should consider its customer, product and activity profiles, distribution channels, complexity and volume of transactions, processes and systems, operating environment.

 - Should ensure:

   - Employees are trained for ML.
   - Frequent reports (at least annually) to governing body/board, senior management, at least annual report from MLRO on soundness of controls.
   - Documentation of ML risk management policies, and application of them.
   - ML risk is taken into account in day-to-day ops when developing new products, taking on new customers, changing its "business profile".
   - Not to unreasonable deny services to those that cannot reasonable demonstrate identity (weird).

 - Must allocate to a director or senior manager, who may be MLRO, overall responsibility for anti-ML systems/controls. A firm may not allocate that to a person who is approved to perform the other overall responsibility function.

WTF. ChatGPT says this is a "catch all" function. I think it's saying that the role can't be "left to catch-all" but must be explicitly defined. It can be a "single person company CEO".

 - The money laundering reporting officer

   - A firm, except sole trader, must:

	   - Appoint an MLRO, and
	   - Ensure they are authorised and independent in the firm, with access rights.

   - Usually in UK.

 - Financial crime guidance

   - See FGC, Financial Crime Guide: A firm's guide to countering financial crime risks, and FCTR, Financial Crime Thematic Reviews.

## SYSC 7.1 Risk control

ESMA has also issued guidelines under article 16(3) of the ESMA Regulation covering certain aspects of the MiFID compliance function requirements. See  http://www.esma.europa.eu/content/Guidelines-certain-aspects-MiFID-compliance-function-requirements

 - Application to a common platform firm

	Not applicable

 - Application to an MiFID optional exemption firm and to a third country firm

   - Seems to say defer to SYSC 1 Annex as many "applications" parts do.

 - Risk assessment

   - SYSC 4.1.1 R requires a firm to have effective processes to identify, manage, monitor and report the "risks" it is or might be exposed to.

   - Presumably it means financial risks?!

   - "must" applies to UCITS investment firm and operator of an electronic system in relation to lending, else "should".

   - A management company should be aware that COLL 6.11 contains requirements in relation to risk control and internal reporting that will apply to it.

   - Full-scope UK AIFMs should be aware that FUND 3.7 and articles 38 to 47 of the AIFMD level 2 regulation contain further requirements in relation to risk management.
	
 - Risk management

   - Repeats itself.

   - Not applicable stuff about managers reviewing risks, and controls, and mentions also risks from macroeconomy, business cycle.

   - MIFIDPRU investment firms should refer to MIFIDPRU 7 for more specific details on risk management expectations.

   - Guidance for other firms.

   - SYSC 7.1.5 probably not applicable, aUCITS investment firm or an operator of an electronic system in relation to lending.

   - If big, complex, aUCITS investment firm or an operator of an electronic system in relation to lending should make a risk management function who reports to senior personnel. Else it must demonstrate compliance with risk.

   - Guidance for others.

   - SYSC 7.1.7B and BA and BD has notes on remuneration.

 - Risk control: additional provisions

   - Consider added guidance in SYSC 21.

   - Says that for common platform firm risk means "risk exposure" and for SMCR firm that is PRA authorised person, the risk management function is a PRA controlled function, as too for an enhanced scope SMCR firm.

   - Weird bunch of empty headers.

 - Additional rules for firms falling under The Capital Requirements Regulations 2013.

   - Not applicable, banks etc.

## SYSC 21.1 Risk Control: Guidance on Governance Arrangements

### Additional Guidance on Governance Arrangements

- **Purpose and Scope**
  - This chapter offers extra guidance on governance arrangements focused on risk management. It builds on the general organizational requirements found in SYSC 2, SYSC 3, SYSC 4, SYSC 7, and FUND 3.7. It applies similarly to insurers, managing agents, the Society, other firms, and full-scope UK AIFMs of authorized AIFs.

- **Considerations for Firms**
  - Firms should evaluate, based on their size, nature, and complexity, whether their risk control arrangements should include:
    - Appointing a Chief Risk Officer (CRO).
    - Establishing a governing body risk committee.
  - The roles of a CRO and a governing body risk committee are detailed further in this section.

- **Applicability to Firms**
  - The FCA suggests that banks and insurers in the FTSE 100 Index should adopt these risk control structures. This guidance may also apply to similar-sized firms and some smaller firms, depending on their risk profile or complexity.

- **Solvency II Firms**
  - For Solvency II firms, the PRA Rulebook designates the chief risk function as a PRA-controlled function.
  - The chief risk function oversees the risk management system as specified in the PRA Rulebook.
  - Solvency II firms can interpret references to the Chief Risk Officer in SYSC 21 as referring to the risk management function in the PRA Rulebook.

### Chief Risk Officer

    - Be accountable to the firm's governing body for overseeing firm-wide risk management.
    - Be independent of individual business units.
    - Have the authority, stature, and resources needed to perform effectively.
    - Have unrestricted access to any part of the business affecting the firm's risk profile.

- **Accountability and Reporting**
  - The CRO should be accountable to the firm's governing body.
  - An executive reporting line is necessary for operational management, typically to the chief executive, chief finance officer, or another executive director.

### Appointment of Chief Risk Officer

- **Remuneration and Removal**
  - The CRO's remuneration should be approved by the governing body or a sub-committee.
  - The CRO cannot be removed without the governing body's approval.

- **SMCR Banking Firms**
  - Procedures should ensure the independence of the CRO is not compromised by removal or disciplinary actions.
  - Approval for removal or disciplinary actions should involve a majority of the governing body, including non-executive members.

### Governing Body Risk Committee

- **Purpose and Responsibilities**
  - Firms should consider establishing a governing body risk committee to support risk governance.
  - Responsibilities may include advising on risk strategy, overseeing risk exposures, developing risk appetite proposals, overseeing stress testing, and advising on remuneration risk weightings.

- **Committee Composition**
  - The chairman should be a non-executive director, and membership should mainly consist of non-executives, though senior executives like the chief finance officer may be included.

- **Collaboration with Audit Functions**
  - The governing body and risk committee should consider advice from the audit committee or internal audit on control effectiveness and seek expert advice as needed.

## SYSC 27 Senior managers and certification regime: Certification regime

## SYSC 27.1 Application and Purpose

### Application

- **Who it applies to:**
  - <mark>This chapter applies to an SMCR firm, except those excluded by SYSC 27.6, below</mark>.
  - <mark>It is also relevant to employees of SMCR firms performing functions specified as FCA certification functions</mark>.

### Purpose

- **What it's about:**
  - This chapter is about the FCA’s certification regime.
  - Under this regime, a firm should <mark>ensure that its employees only perform an FCA certification function if they have a certificate issued by that firm to perform that function</mark>.
  - The purpose is to specify ‘FCA certification functions’ and provide guidance on the FCA’s certification regime.

### Note - ChatGPT Explainer

In the FCA’s **SYSC 27** rules under the **Senior Managers and Certification Regime (SM&CR)**, the term **"certificate"** refers to a document issued by a firm to individuals performing **certification functions** to confirm that they are **fit and proper** to carry out their role.

### **Who Issues the Certificate?**
The **firm itself** (i.e., the employer) is responsible for issuing the certificate—not the FCA. The firm must assess the individual's **fitness and propriety** at least **annually** before issuing or renewing the certificate.

### **What Does the Certificate Look Like?**
There is no **prescribed format** from the FCA, but the certificate must include:
1. **The name of the individual** being certified.
2. **The functions** they are certified to perform.
3. **A statement that the firm is satisfied** that the individual is fit and proper to carry out those functions.

### **Key Points:**
- It is an internal certification, not an FCA-issued license.
- The firm must ensure employees meet **honesty, integrity, competence, and financial soundness** standards.
- If a firm decides an employee is **not fit and proper**, they must not issue or renew the certificate.

## SYSC 27.2 Requirements of the Certification Regime

### General

- **Overview:**

  - SYSC 22 deals with obtaining references from previous employers.

### Issuing and Renewing Certificates

- **Certificate details:**
  - A certificate <mark>must state the person is fit and proper and outline their role</mark>.

## COCON 3 General factors for assessing compliance

## COCON 3.1 General factors for assessing compliance

- **Examples of Conduct**

  - The examples of conduct in this chapter that illustrate breaches of COCON rules are not exhaustive. They do not cover all possible conduct that might break the rules.

- **Assessing Compliance or Breach**

  - When evaluating compliance with or a breach of a COCON rule, the FCA will consider the context of the conduct, including:
    - The specific circumstances of the case.
    - The characteristics of the function performed by the individual.
    - The expected behavior in that function.

- **Personal Culpability**

  - A person is only in breach of COCON rules if they are personally responsible. Personal culpability occurs when:
    - <mark>The conduct was intentional.</mark>
    - <mark>The conduct fell below what would be reasonable in the circumstances.</mark>

- **Factors for Compliance Determination**

  - When determining if a person's conduct complies with COCON rules, the FCA will consider:
    - If the conduct relates to activities covered by other Handbook provisions.
    - If the conduct aligns with the regulatory system's requirements and standards relevant to the person's firm.

- **Senior Conduct Rules Staff Member Compliance**

  - In assessing if a senior conduct rules staff member complies with rules SC1 to SC4, the FCA will consider:
    - Whether they used reasonable care with the information available.
    - Whether they reached a reasonable conclusion to act upon.
    - The nature, scale, and complexity of the firm's business.
    - Their role and responsibility as outlined in their statement of responsibility.
    - Their knowledge of any regulatory concerns related to their role.

- **Reasonableness of Conduct**

  - When assessing if a senior conduct rules staff member may have breached a COCON rule, the business's nature, scale, and complexity, and the individual's role and responsibility will be relevant. Smaller and less complex businesses require less detailed systems of control.

- **UK Corporate Governance Code**

  - UK domestic firms listed in the equity shares (commercial companies) or closed-ended investment funds categories must follow the UK Corporate Governance Code. This includes internal control provisions explained in the Financial Reporting Council's publication on risk management and internal control. Firms in these categories must adhere to this code and COCON rules. The FCA will give credit if a senior conduct rules staff member follows the UK Corporate Governance Code and related guidance.

## FIT 2.1 Honesty, Integrity, and Reputation

- **General Considerations by the FCA**
  - The FCA considers all relevant matters when assessing a person's honesty, integrity, and reputation, including those listed in FIT 2.1.3 G. These matters can arise in the UK or elsewhere. The FCA should be informed of these matters, but will only consider them if they are relevant to regulatory standards. For example, <mark>a criminal conviction does not automatically disqualify a candidate</mark>. Each case is assessed individually, considering the seriousness and context of the offence, the candidate's explanation, relevance to the role, time elapsed since the offence, and evidence of rehabilitation.

- **Considerations by Firms**
  - Firms should also consider all relevant matters when assessing staff under FIT, including those in FIT 2.1.3G. This includes checking for criminal convictions and contacting previous employers. If a staff member has a criminal conviction, firms should evaluate the seriousness and context of the offence, the person's explanation, relevance to the role, time since the offence, and evidence of rehabilitation.

- **Impact on Firm's Reputation**
  - The FCA will assess whether a person's reputation could negatively impact the firm for which they perform a controlled function, considering their responsibilities.

- **Firm's Assessment of Reputation**
  - Firms should consider if a person's reputation might adversely affect the firm and the responsibilities of the role they are to perform.

- **Specific Matters for Consideration**
  - The FCA and firms should consider:
    1. Criminal convictions, including spent convictions, especially for dishonesty, fraud, financial crime, or offences related to financial services.
    2. Adverse findings or settlements in civil proceedings, especially related to financial misconduct.
    3. Involvement in investigations or disciplinary proceedings by regulators or professional bodies.
    4. Disciplinary or criminal proceedings, or notifications of potential proceedings.
    5. Breaches of regulatory standards or equivalent standards of other authorities.
    6. Justified complaints related to regulated activities.
    7. Involvement with organisations that have had their registration or licence revoked.
    8. Refusal of the right to carry on a trade or profession due to licence removal.
    9. Management roles in businesses that went insolvent.
    10. Investigations or disciplinary actions by regulatory or professional bodies.
    11. Dismissal or resignation from employment or positions of trust.
    12. Disqualification from acting as a director or in managerial roles.
    13. Past candor and truthfulness in dealings with regulatory bodies and willingness to comply with regulatory standards.

## FIT 2.2 Competence and Capability

- **FCA's Assessment**
  - The FCA considers all relevant matters when determining a person's competence and capability, including:
    1. Compliance with FCA training and competence requirements for the controlled function.
    2. Suitability demonstrated through experience and training.
    3. Adequate time to perform the controlled function and associated responsibilities.

- **Firm's Assessment**
  - Firms should consider similar factors when assessing competence and capability for senior management or certification functions, including:
    1. Compliance with applicable training and competence requirements.
    2. Suitability demonstrated through experience and training.
    3. Adequate time to perform the function and meet responsibilities.

  - The FCA considers convictions or dismissals for drug or alcohol abuse only in relation to the person's ability to perform the controlled function.

## FIT 2.3 Financial Soundness

- **FCA's Considerations**
  - The FCA considers factors such as:
    1. Outstanding judgment debts or awards.
    2. Bankruptcy-related proceedings or arrangements with creditors.

- **Firm's Considerations**
  - Firms should also consider these factors when assessing financial soundness.

- **Financial Means**
  - The FCA does not usually require a statement of assets or liabilities. Limited financial means alone do not affect suitability for a controlled function. Firms are expected to adopt a similar approach.

  - <mark>Unless required by the regulatory system, a firm must ensure that neither it nor anyone acting on its behalf claims, either publicly or to a client, that its affairs have the approval or endorsement of the FCA or another competent authority.</mark>

  - This restriction does not apply if it conflicts with obligations under article 44(8) of the MiFID Org Regulation.

  - The restriction does not apply to statements that clearly and fairly explain that:
    - The firm is an authorised person.
    - The firm has permission to carry out a specific activity.
    - An authorisation order has been made for an AUT, ACS, or ICVC.
    - A recognised scheme has that status.
    - The firm's approved persons have been approved by the appropriate regulator for specific arrangements.
    - The firm has received express written approval from the appropriate regulator for a specific aspect of its affairs.

  - The restriction applies to both regulated and unregulated activities.

- **Written Approval**

  - GEN 1.2.2AR(2)(g) is limited to written approval to ensure clarity about the scope of any approval given by the appropriate regulator.

- **MiFID and Other Business**

  - A firm involved in MiFID, equivalent third country, or optional exemption business should consider the requirement in article 44(8) of the MiFID Org Regulation, as reproduced in COBS 4.5A.16UK.

## GEN 1.3 Emergency

- **Recognition of Emergencies**

  - The FCA acknowledges that emergencies may occur, making it difficult for a person (usually a firm, but sometimes an unauthorised person) to comply with a specific rule in the Handbook. GEN 1.3.2 R provides relief from the consequences of such rule contraventions in emergencies.

- **Conditions for Relief**

  - If an emergency arises that:
    - Makes it impractical to comply with a specific rule.
    - Could not have been avoided by taking all reasonable steps.
    - Is beyond the control of the person, their associates, agents, and employees.
  
  - The person will not be in contravention of that rule to the extent that compliance is impractical due to the emergency.

  - This relief applies only as long as:
    - The emergency's consequences continue.
    - The person demonstrates they are taking all practical steps to address the consequences, comply with the rule, and mitigate losses to clients.

- **Notification Requirements**

  - The person must notify the FCA as soon as possible about the emergency and the steps being taken to address it.

  - Notifications must be given in accordance with SUP 15.7 (Form and method of notification). If the person is not a firm, the notification should be addressed to the FCA's Contact Centre.

- **Ongoing Communication**

  - A firm should keep the FCA informed of the steps it is taking to comply with its obligations under Principle 11 (Relations with regulators).

- **Definition of Practicability**

  - An action is not considered practicable if it requires unreasonable efforts.

- **FCA's Powers**

  - GEN 1.3.2 R applies to the FCA's rules but does not limit the FCA's power to take action against a firm in an emergency for contravening other requirements. The FCA may use its own-initiative power to vary a firm's Part 4A permission if necessary.

## GEN 2.2 Interpreting the Handbook

### Purposive interpretation

- **GEN 2.2.1 R 21/06/2001 RP**
  - Every provision in the Handbook must be interpreted in light of its purpose.

- **GEN 2.2.2 G 21/06/2001 RP**
  - The purpose of any provision in the Handbook should be understood primarily from the text of the provision and its context among other relevant provisions. Guidance on the purpose of a provision is meant to help readers but is not a complete or definitive explanation.

### Evidential provisions

- **GEN 2.2.3 R 01/04/2013 RP**
  - Any rule in the Handbook with the status letter "E" in the margin or heading:
    1. Indicates that <mark>breaking the rule does not lead to consequences under the Act other than section 138C (Evidential provisions).</mark>
    2. Includes the status letter "E" as part of the rule.

- **GEN 2.2.4 G 03/07/2016 RP**
  - Rules to which section 138C of the Act applies ("evidential provisions") are marked with "E". Other provisions marked with "E" are not rules but are in codes, and GEN 2.2.3 R does not apply to them.

- **GEN 2.2.5 G 01/01/2006 RP**
  - Chapter 6 of the Reader's Guide explains the significance of status letters R, E, G, D, UK, EU, P, and C, and provides more information on Handbook provisions, including evidential provisions.

### Use of defined expressions

- **GEN 2.2.6 G 01/07/2012 RP**
  - Expressions with defined meanings appear in italics in the Handbook, unless stated otherwise in individual sourcebooks or manuals.

- **GEN 2.2.7 R 31/12/2004 RP**
  - In the Handbook (except IPRU, unless indicated otherwise):
    1. An italicized expression defined in the Glossary has the meaning given there.
    2. An italicized expression related to a Glossary definition must be interpreted accordingly.

- **GEN 2.2.8 G 01/03/2016 RP**
  - Examples of related expressions include:
    1. "advice on investments" and "advise on investments" should be interpreted by reference to "advising on investments".
    2. "closely linked" should be interpreted by reference to "close links".
    3. "controls" and "controlled" should be interpreted by reference to "control".
    4. "effect", as in "effect a life policy", should be interpreted by reference to "effecting contracts of insurance".
    5. "employment" should be interpreted by reference to "employee".

- **GEN 2.2.9 G 01/07/2012 RP**
  - Unless the context requires otherwise or stated in a particular sourcebook or manual, where italics are not used, an expression bears its natural meaning, subject to the Interpretation Act 1978.

- **GEN 2.2.10 G 21/06/2001 RP**
  - The Interim Prudential sourcebooks (IPRU) have individual arrangements for defined terms, and each contains rules or guidance on its own arrangements. Do not rely on Glossary definitions unless indicated.

### Application of the Interpretation Act 1978

- **GEN 2.2.11 R 21/06/2001 RP**
  - The Interpretation Act 1978 applies to the Handbook.

- **GEN 2.2.12 G 01/03/2024 RP**
  - The Interpretation Act 1978's application to the Handbook means:
    1. Expressions used in the Handbook that are in the Act have the same meanings unless a contrary intention appears.
    2. References to an enactment in the Handbook are to that enactment as amended, including extensions or applications by other enactments, unless a contrary intention appears.
    3. Unless a contrary intention appears:
       - Words importing masculine gender include feminine and vice versa.
       - Words in the singular include the plural and vice versa.

  - References to stepchildren, step-parents, etc., in provisions made before 5 December 2005 are interpreted according to section 246 of the Civil Partnership Act 2004.

- **GEN 2.2.12B G 05/12/2005 RP**
  - GEN 2.2.12A R and sections 246 and 247 of the Civil Partnership Act 2004 amend references to stepchildren and related expressions to account for civil partnerships. For example, a stepchild of a person includes the child of the civil partner of that person.

### Cross-references in the Handbook

    - References to enactments in the Glossary are construed as references to those enactments as amended over time.

- **GEN 2.2.13A R 04/12/2015 RP**
  - Unless a contrary intention appears, if an FCA provision cross-references a non-FCA provision (including deleted PRA provisions), the referred provision is treated as made by the FCA to ensure the cross-reference functions effectively.

- **GEN 2.2.13B G 04/12/2015 RP**
  - GEN 2.2.13AR ensures cross-references in the FCA Handbook to provisions outside it are effective, including references to material formerly in the PRA Handbook but now deleted.

### References to writing

- **GEN 2.2.14 R 21/06/2001 RP**
  - If a Handbook provision refers to a document "in writing", it means in legible form and capable of being reproduced on paper, regardless of the medium used, unless a contrary intention appears.

- **GEN 2.2.15 G 01/04/2013 RP**
  - GEN 2.2.14 R allows electronic media for communications required to be "in writing", unless a contrary intention appears or it contravenes another requirement. It does not affect other legal requirements for document execution.

- **GEN 2.2.15A G 01/04/2013 RP**
  - An example of a requirement relevant to electronic media use for "in writing" communications is the requirement to treat customers fairly under Principle 6.

- **GEN 2.2.16 G 21/06/2001 RP**
  - "Document" is defined in the Glossary to include information recorded in any form, including electronic form.

### Activities covered by general rules

- **GEN 2.2.17 R 04/11/2016 RP**
  - A general rule is interpreted as:
    1. Applying to a firm for all regulated activities, unless a contrary intention appears.
    2. Not applying to unregulated activities, unless a contrary intention appears.

### Continuity of authorised partnerships and unincorporated associations

- **GEN 2.2.18 R 06/07/2006 RP**
  - If a partnership or unincorporated association is dissolved but its authorisation continues under section 32 of the Act, the successor is regarded as the same firm for Handbook purposes unless the context requires otherwise.

- **GEN 2.2.19 G 06/02/2008 RP**
  - A change in partners or members can form a new partnership or association. GEN 2.2.18 R reflects section 32 of the Act, ensuring continuing authorisation if conditions are met, maintaining the status of the partnership or association as a "firm" or "authorised person" for Handbook purposes.

### Designated investment exchanges

- **GEN 2.2.20 G 01/01/2006 RP**
  - The Glossary defines designated investment exchanges, listing certain exchanges. More information and guidance on adding an exchange to the list is in GEN 2 Annex 1 G, and the application fee obligation is in FEES 3.2.

### European Economic Area (EEA)

#### Registered persons

- **GEN 2.2.20A G 08/10/2023**
  - Registered persons can communicate financial promotions about qualifying cryptoassets using an exemption in article 73ZA of the Financial Promotion Order.
  - The Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (Financial Promotion) (Amendment) Order 2023 applies certain powers in the Act to registered persons for their communication of financial promotions under this exemption.
  - The FCA can exercise supervisory and enforcement powers over registered persons. Guidance on these powers for authorised persons also applies to registered persons, and references to firms should be construed accordingly.

### Treaty of Lisbon

- **GEN 2.2.22 G 01/01/2021 RP**
  - Due to the Treaty of Lisbon, the European Union has replaced the European Community. References to the European Community in the Handbook should be interpreted as references to the European Union where context requires.

### Onshored Regulations and third country firms

- **GEN 2.2.22A R 01/01/2021 RP**
  - Unless exempted, MiFIR and onshored regulations from MiFIR or MiFID apply to a third country investment firm as if it were a UK MiFID investment firm when:
    1. It carries on MiFID or equivalent third country business.
    2. The business is conducted from a UK establishment.
  - Paragraph (1) does not apply if:
    1. MiFIR or an onshored regulation imposes a specific requirement for a third country investment firm.
    2. Onshored regulations were previously EU regulations under article 7 of MiFID.
  - Paragraph (1) is modified by application provisions in individual Handbook chapters.
  - GEN 2.2.22AR(1) is subject to articles 2A to 2E of MiFIR and article 1(3) to (5) of the MiFID Org Regulation.
  - For TP firms, GEN 2.2.22AR(1) does not apply additional requirements imposed by MiFIR or the MiFID Org Regulation beyond those in articles 2A to 2E MiFIR and article 1(3) to (5) of the MiFID Org Regulation.

- **GEN 2.2.22B G 01/01/2021 RP**
  - The purpose of GEN 2.2.22AR is to ensure a third country investment firm is not treated more favorably than a UK firm.
  - GEN 2.2.22AR may be overridden by application provisions at the beginning of individual Handbook chapters.

### Application of provisions where there are commensurate PRA provisions

- **GEN 2.2.23 R 26/01/2017 RP**
  - This rule applies to Handbook provisions where the PRA has made commensurate provisions in the PRA Rulebook. It may affect their application by the FCA to PRA-authorised persons and PRA approved persons.
  - Where a Handbook provision exceeds the FCA's powers or responsibilities, it applies only to the extent of the FCA’s powers and responsibilities.
  - The extent of a Handbook provision is reduced by the minimum degree necessary.

- **GEN 2.2.24 G 01/04/2013 RP**
  - The published Memorandum of Understanding between the FCA and the PRA describes their regulatory responsibilities.

- **GEN 2.2.25 G 26/01/2017 RP**
  - An example of a rule being reduced by GEN 2.2.23R is SYSC 6.1.1R, which requires a firm to maintain adequate policies and procedures for compliance with its obligations under the regulatory system. SYSC 6.1.1R should be interpreted as applied by the FCA for a PRA-authorised person’s compliance with FCA responsibilities, such as banking conduct requirements in BCOBS.

### Rules applying while a firm has temporary permission: the General Rules

- **GEN 2.2.26 R 01/01/2021**
  - Unless a contrary intention appears, a rule does not apply to a TP firm except:
    1. A rule that imposed an obligation on a person before IP completion day who becomes a TP firm continues to apply to the same extent and activities.
    2. A rule dealing with a matter reserved to the Home State or EEA state under an EU directive applies to a TP firm if it applies to a UK firm carrying on the same regulated activity and implemented an EU directive provision before IP completion day.
    3. A TP firm carrying on an activity from its UK branch does not contravene a rule if it complied with a provision implementing the same directive provision reserved to its Home State.
    4. A TP firm carrying on an activity into the UK does not contravene a rule if it complied with a provision implementing the same directive provision reserved to its Home State.
    5. Paragraph (3) or (4) does not apply unless a TP firm can demonstrate compliance with the provision.
    6. If a TP firm’s Home State exercises a national discretion not to apply a provision, the TP firm does not need to comply with the rule.
    7. A provision includes one where an EU directive sets options, and the state chose different options than the FCA.

### Amendments to rules applied by the General Rules

- **GEN 2.2.27 R 04/10/2024**
  - A rule applied by GEN 2.2.26R(1) or GEN 2.2.26R(2):
    1. Applies with any amendment made on IP completion day to address an issue from the UK’s withdrawal from the EU.
    2. Applies until deleted after IP completion day, or continues as amended or replaced unless stated otherwise.
    3. Only applies to activities from a UK branch or establishment or into the UK.
  - Apart from in COMP and FEES 6, where a rule applied by GEN 2.2.26R(1) or GEN 2.2.26R(2) was deleted on IP completion day, deletion is disregarded, and it continues to apply to the TP firm, with references to the EU deemed as UK.

### Modification of rules applied by the General Rules in cases of conflict

- **GEN 2.2.28 R 01/01/2021**
  - Where a rule in GEN 2.2.26R(1) applies and:
    1. An amendment on IP completion day removes a reference to an EEA matter, and it is impracticable for the TP firm to comply, the firm may treat the rule as if it continued to refer to the EEA matter.
    2. If a rule applied by GEN 2.2.26R(1) contradicts a rule applied by GEN 2.2.26R(2), the rule in GEN 2.2.26R(2) does not apply.
    3. If different provisions apply in an EEA State to a TP firm due to the UK’s withdrawal from the EU, and complying with a rule applied by GEN 2.2.26R(2) would contravene a provision in that EEA State, the rule in GEN 2.2.26R(2) does not apply.

### MiFID technical standards

- **GEN 2.2.29 R 04/10/2024**
  - Provisions, as amended on or after IP completion day, apply to a TP firm which is an EEA MiFID investment firm as if it were a MiFID investment firm when:
    1. It carries on MiFID or equivalent third country business.
    2. The business is conducted from a UK branch or provided into the UK.
  - The provisions are technical standards from previously adopted EU regulations under MiFID, except:
    1. Those from EU regulations under article 7 of MiFID.
    2. Those from EU regulations under article 32(2) and (3) of MiFID for firms other than TP firms operating an organised trading facility or acting as a systematic internaliser from a UK branch.
    3. To the extent inconsistent with Chapter 5 of the MiFID Org Regulation or MAR 10.4.
  - A TP firm from a UK branch does not contravene a rule if it complied with the same provision applied by its Home State.
  - A TP firm into the UK does not contravene a rule if it complied with the same provision applied by its Home State.
  - A rule in (3) or (4) does not apply unless a TP firm can demonstrate compliance with the provision.
  - Neither paragraphs (3) nor (5) apply to rules from EU regulations under article 27 of MiFID.

### Rules and guidance applying while a firm has temporary permission – capital adequacy requirements

- **GEN 2.2.30 R 01/01/2022**
  - Nothing in GENPRU, MIFIDPRU, INSPRU, MIPRU, IPRU(FSOC), IPRU(INS), or IPRU(INV) applies to a TP firm, except for provisions in (2).
  - To the extent a TP firm carries on the relevant regulated activity, the following apply by GEN 2.2.26R:
    1. INSPRU 1.5.33R.
    2. MIPRU.
    3. IPRU(FSOC).
    4. IPRU(INV) 5, 6, 12, and 13, except capital adequacy rules in these chapters do not apply to a TP firm.

- **GEN 2.2.31 G 01/01/2022**
  - GEN 2.2.30R excludes the application of sourcebooks in the Prudential Standards part of the FCA Handbook, except those in GEN 2.2.30R(2).
  - Sourcebooks in GEN 2.2.30R(2) may apply to a TP firm by GEN 2.2.26R(1) if they applied before IP completion day, or by GEN 2.2.26R(2) if conditions are met, and the rule does not relate to capital adequacy.
  - The approach in GEN 2.2.30R ensures a TP firm is only subject to capital adequacy rules that applied before IP completion day.
  - Sourcebooks in GEN 2.2.30R(2) contain rules not related to capital adequacy, which may apply to TP firms by GEN 2.2.26R.
  - Other sourcebooks may include capital adequacy rules that apply to a TP firm by GEN 2.2.26R, but not additional requirements beyond those before IP completion day.
  - Rules relating to capital adequacy include financial resources adequacy, but not professional indemnity insurance unless tied to capital adequacy. Such rules may apply to a TP firm by GEN 2.2.26R, but not if tied to capital adequacy by GEN 2.2.26R(2).

### Rules applying while a firm has temporary recognition – general – TP UCITS qualifiers

- **GEN 2.2.32 R 04/10/2024**
  - Unless a contrary intention appears, a rule does not apply to a TP UCITS qualifier, except:
    1. A rule that imposed an obligation on a person before IP completion day who becomes a TP UCITS qualifier continues to apply to the same extent and activities.
    2. If a person becomes a TP UCITS qualifier for a new sub-fund after IP completion day, a rule that would have applied before IP completion day applies to the new sub-fund to the same extent and activities.

### Amendments to rules applied to TP UCITS qualifiers

- **GEN 2.2.33 R 04/10/2024**
  - A rule applied by GEN 2.2.32R:
    1. Applies with any amendment made on IP completion day from the UK’s exit from the EU.
    2. Applies until deleted after IP completion day, or continues as amended or replaced unless stated otherwise.
    3. Only applies to activities in relation to the AIF or scheme in the UK.
  - Where a rule applied by GEN 2.2.32R was deleted on IP completion day, deletion is disregarded, and it continues to apply to the TP UCITS qualifier, with references to the EU deemed as UK.

### Modification of rules applied to TP UCITS qualifiers

- **GEN 2.2.34 R 04/10/2024**
  - Where a rule in GEN 2.2.32R applies and:
    1. An amendment on IP completion day removes a reference to an EEA matter, and it is impracticable for the TP UCITS qualifier to comply, the qualifier may treat the rule as if it continued to refer to the EEA matter.
    2. If complying with a rule applied by GEN 2.2.32R would contravene a provision in its Home State, the rule does not apply.

### Guidance applying while a firm has temporary permission

- **GEN 2.2.35 R 04/10/2024**
  - Unless a contrary intention appears, guidance does not apply to a TP firm or TP UCITS qualifier except:
    1. Guidance on a rule applied by GEN 2.2.26R(1) applies to a TP firm to the same extent as that rule.
    2. Guidance on a rule applied by GEN 2.2.26R(2) applies to a TP firm to the same extent as that rule.
    3. Guidance on a rule applied by GEN 2.2.32R applies to a TP UCITS qualifier to the same extent as that rule.
    4. Guidance on an enactment applying to both a TP firm and a firm with Part 4A permission applies to a TP firm to the same extent. If an enactment is modified for the EU Exit Passport Regulations, guidance must be read subject to those modifications. This applies similarly to guidance for TP UCITS qualifiers.

- **GEN 2.2.35A G 04/11/2024**
  - A TP firm should refer to provisions identifying rules and guidance in their sourcebooks that came into force after IP completion day and apply to TP firms.

### Purpose

- **GEN 2.2.36 G 04/10/2024**
  - The approach to rules for TP firms is to apply rules that applied immediately before IP completion day, whether in the UK or in the firm’s Home State or relevant state.
  - Glossary definitions of TP firm and temporary permission now apply only to firms in the financial services contracts regime under Part 6 of the EU Exit Passport Regulations.
  - GEN 2.2.26R (1) and GEN 2.2.33R refer to rules imposing substantive obligations, not rules setting application.
  - GEN 2.2.26R to GEN 2.2.35R apply rules and guidance to firms with passporting rights under the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union or the EEA Agreement.
  - The application of rules and guidance to TP firms considers the purpose of temporary permission under Part 6 of the Regulations, allowing TP firms to continue regulated activities in the UK, or for TP UCITS qualifiers to market funds in the UK, considering the changed legal framework post-EU law.
  - For a TP firm under Part 6 of the EU Exit Passport Regulations, the scope of authorisation is preserved but limited to what is permitted under regulation 33 or 40 of those Regulations.
  - The General Rules apply where regulated activities have been amended on IP completion day, enabling TP firms to continue such activities in the UK.
  - Part 6 of the Collective Investment Schemes (Amendment etc.) (EU Exit) Regulations 2019 allows a new sub-fund to be a recognised scheme, ensuring a rule applies to a TP UCITS qualifier for a new sub-fund if it would have applied before IP completion day.
  - For persons with temporary EMI, PI, and RAISP authorisation, specified directions, rules, and guidance in FEES 4A, 7C, and 13A apply, along with DISP, SUP, PRIN, and BCOBS as they apply to UK-authorised institutions.
  - A person with temporary EMI authorisation is deemed an authorised electronic money institution, subject to the Electronic Money Regulations and exclusions in the E-money and Payments Transitional Provisions Regulations.
  - For persons with temporary PI authorisation and temporary RAISP registration, the Payment Services Regulations apply, subject to exclusions in the E-money and Payments Transitional Provisions Regulations.
  - Glossary definitions of temporary EMI, PI, and RAISP authorisation now apply only to persons in the financial services contracts regime under the E-money and Payments Transitional Provisions Regulations.

### The effect of the General Rules

- **GEN 2.2.37 G 04/10/2024**
  - The approach in these rules is general and does not apply where a rule states a different provision applies or that position is stated.
  - The FCA has specifically applied rules to TP firms in certain cases, such as:
    1. Principles for Businesses (PRIN).
    2. Fees Manual (FEES) chapters 4A, 6, 7C, 7D, and 13A, and rule 5.1.1CR.
    3. General Provisions (GEN) on status disclosure.
    4. Client Assets sourcebook (CASS) chapter 14.
    5. Compensation sourcebook (COMP).
    6. Dispute Resolution: Complaints sourcebook (DISP) chapters 1, 2, and 3.
    7. Approved persons regime in the Supervision Manual (SUP) 10A.
    8. Senior managers and certification regime in the Senior Management Arrangements, Systems and Controls sourcebook (SYSC) at SYSC 23.3.3G.
  - GEN 2.2.26R(1) and GEN 2.2.32R include rules applying to a firm’s activity beyond its permitted activity under Schedule 3 or 4 to the Act or beyond permitted activity under paragraph 2(1) of Schedule 5 to the Act.
  - None of GEN 2.2.26R(1), GEN 2.2.26R(2), and GEN 2.2.32R prevent changes to rules applying to such firms on and after IP completion day.
  - GEN 2.2.26R(2) refers to rules dealing with matters reserved to the Home State, including rules always the responsibility of that state or depending on where the service or activity takes place.
  - The effect of GEN 2.2.26R(2) is to apply a rule implementing an EU directive, even if the matter was reserved to the Home State or the state where the service is provided. A rule imposed by a national discretion in a directive is taken as implementing a directive. If a TP firm’s home state exercises a national discretion not to apply a provision, the firm does not need to comply with the rule. A more stringent rule applied by the FCA in relation to a minimum harmonisation EU directive would not be applied by GEN 2.2.26R(2).
  - The General Rules in GEN 2.2.26R to 2.2.31G do not address EEA fund managers only marketing funds in the UK without carrying on regulated activity. Persons only marketing are defined as TP UCITS qualifiers and TP AIFM qualifiers, covered by GEN 2.2.32R, 2.2.33R, 2.2.34R, and 2.2.35R.
  - An example of a matter in GEN 2.2.28R(1) or GEN 2.2.34R(1) may be a rule referring only to UK professional body membership. Where applicable, the firm may treat the rule as if it continued to refer to an EEA professional body.
  - TP firms may find it helpful to refer to the table in SUP 13A Annex 1 (Rules that apply to incoming EEA firms) as it applied before IP completion day, but it will not apply entirely to each TP firm. For example, a TP firm with top-up permission needs to comply with rules for that activity, and specified rules deleted on IP completion day are not applied by the General Rules as set out in GEN 2.2.27R(2).
  - TP firms may find it helpful to refer to the table in SUP 13A Annex 2G (Matters reserved to the home state) as it applied before IP completion day.

### Rules and guidance applying while a firm has temporary permission – tied agents

- **GEN 2.2.38 G 01/01/2021**
  - A tied agent that is an appointed representative may not start acting as a tied agent until included on the Financial Services Register.
  - To ensure inclusion, a TP firm should complete the Appointed representative appointment form in SUP 12 Annex 3R when appointing a tied agent for MiFID business in the UK.
  - A TP firm terminating its relationship with a tied agent should complete the Appointed representative termination form in SUP 12 Annex 5R to remove the agent from the Financial Services Register.

### TP firms that enter the financial services contracts regime under Part 6 of the EU Exit Passport Regulations

- **GEN 2.2.39 G 01/01/2021**
  - As TP firm and temporary permission definitions include TP firms under Part 6 of the EU Exit Passport Regulations, rules and guidance in GEN 2.2.26R to GEN 2.2.35G apply to firms entering the financial services contracts regime after IP completion day.
  - The application of rules and guidance to TP firms under Part 6 of the EU Exit Passport Regulations considers the purpose of temporary permission, enabling such a TP firm to run down its regulated business in the UK. Regulation 33 or 40 of the EU Exit Passport Regulations sets the scope of permitted activities.
  - Rules and guidance in GEN 2.2.26R to 2.2.31G, and 2.2.35R to 2.2.37G continue to apply where a TP firm leaves temporary permission under Part 3 and enters temporary permission under Part 6 of the EU Exit Passport Regulations.
  - GEN 2.2.27R applies changes between IP completion day and when the person enters temporary permission under the regulation in question to the TP firm.
  - Where a TP firm enters temporary permission under regulation 32 of the EU Exit Passport Regulations, a rule in GEN 2.2.26R(1) applies again, with changes referred to in paragraph (3). Rules applied by GEN 2.2.26R(2) apply with changes referred to in paragraph (3).

## GEN 2.3 General saving of the Handbook for Gibraltar

### Continued application of the Handbook with respect to Gibraltar

- **GEN 2.3.1 R 29/07/2022**
  - The FCA Handbook, after IP completion day, confers rights and imposes obligations in relation to Gibraltar corresponding to those before IP completion day.
  - Provisions applying to Gibraltar before IP completion day continue to apply after, with necessary modifications, unless a contrary intention is indicated.
  - "Gibraltar" includes rights or obligations related to Gibraltar-based firms, public institutions, residents, body corporates, and firm activities in Gibraltar.
  - A Gibraltar-based firm with permission for funeral plan provision or distribution must comply with relevant Handbook provisions.

### Extent of guidance applying in relation to or in connection with Gibraltar

- **GEN 2.3.2 R 01/01/2021**
  - Guidance on a rule applying to Gibraltar before IP completion day continues to apply after, with necessary modifications, unless a contrary intention is indicated.
  - Guidance on an enactment other than a rule continues to apply to Gibraltar as the enactment continues to apply.

### Purpose of GEN 2.3.1R and GEN 2.3.2R

- **GEN 2.3.3 G 01/01/2021**
  - The purpose of GEN 2.3.1R and GEN 2.3.2R is to ensure rules and guidance applying to Gibraltar before IP completion day continue after, despite amendments from the UK’s withdrawal from the EU.
  - Amendments or deletions addressing the UK’s withdrawal from the EU are disregarded if they change the application to Gibraltar.
  - Rules or guidance applying before IP completion day to Gibraltar-based firms, residents, body corporates, or firm activities continue after with necessary modifications.
  - The approach in GEN 2.3.1R is general and does not apply where a rule or guidance states a different provision applies to Gibraltar.
  - The contrary intention in GEN 2.3.1R should be construed in light of regulations under the EUWA. GEN 2.3.1R does not apply where it would be contrary to regulations under the EUWA or incompatible with the legislative scheme.
  - Rules and guidance are saved with necessary modifications to give effect to corresponding rights or obligations before IP completion day. For example, a rule referring only to UK professional body membership may be treated as referring to a Gibraltar-based professional body if necessary.
  - GEN 2.3.1R and GEN 2.3.2R do not prevent changes to rules and guidance applying to Gibraltar after IP completion day.

### Further guidance on GEN 2.3.1R and GEN 2.3.2R as they apply in relation to Gibraltar-based firms exercising market access rights by virtue of the Gibraltar Order

- **GEN 2.3.4 G 01/01/2021**
  - Where GEN 2.3.1R and GEN 2.3.2R apply to a Gibraltar-based firm exercising market access rights by the Gibraltar Order and carrying on activities outside its entitlement, rules and guidance continue to apply by virtue of a Part 4A permission.
  - Gibraltar-based firms exercising market access rights by the Gibraltar Order may find it helpful to refer to the table in SUP 13A Annex 1G (Rules that applied to incoming EEA firms) as it applied before IP completion day, but it will not apply entirely if a firm has a Part 4A permission for other activities.

### Exception for fee rates

- **GEN 2.3.5 G 01/04/2021**
  - Provisions in FEES applying to Gibraltar before IP completion day continue after, except fee rates, which may change each fee year.

## GEN 2A Interpreting the Handbook and other documents during the implementation period

## GEN 2A.1 Introduction

- **Application**

  - <mark>This chapter applies to anyone who is subject to any provision in the FCA Handbook and to anyone reading the Handbook.</mark>

  - It also applies to instruments or documents issued by the FCA under a law that are not part of the FCA Handbook. Therefore, it applies to anyone to whom such an instrument or document applies and to any reader of such an instrument or document.

- **Purpose**

  - Section 1B of the EUWA ensures that UK legislation reflects the implementation period in Part 4 of the withdrawal agreement. For example, it ensures that the term “Member State” in EU-derived legislation includes “the UK” and that references to “EU law” are understood as applicable to the UK by Part 4 of the withdrawal agreement. These provisions also apply to FCA Handbook rules and other legislation made by the FCA.

  - The purpose of this chapter is to confirm and explain that, during the implementation period, the entire FCA Handbook and other documents issued by the FCA should be interpreted in light of section 1B of the EUWA.

- **Interpretation**

  - In this chapter, “EUWA” refers to the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018.

  - Terms like “implementation period”, “EU-derived domestic legislation”, and “enactment” have the same meanings as in the EUWA. The terms “withdrawal agreement” and “IP completion day” have the same meanings as in the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020.

## GEN 2A.2 Interpreting the Handbook and other documents during the implementation period

- During the implementation period, rules, directions (including waivers), guidance, statements of policy and/or procedure, and any other instrument or document made or issued by the FCA under a law should be interpreted in light of section 1B of the EUWA.

- This means that, until IP completion day, these should be read, as far as the context allows or requires, as if:

  - Any reference to the “Treaties” or the “EU Treaties” includes Part 4 of the withdrawal agreement (implementation period), except for parts related to the Common Foreign and Security Policy.

  - The United Kingdom were a member State of the EU.

  - Any reference to:
    - EU law;
    - Any specific EU Treaty or part of it;
    - Any EU instrument, or document of an EU entity or the EU, or any part of such instrument or document;
    - Any part of EU law not covered by the above;
    - Any tax, duty, levy, or interests of the EU; or
    - Any arrangement involving or relating to the EU not mentioned above,
    is a reference to such things as applicable to the UK by Part 4 of the withdrawal agreement.

  - Any reference to the European Communities Act 1972 includes a reference to that act as it continues to have effect by section 1A(2) to (4) of the EUWA.

  - Any reference to the area of the EU or the EEA includes the United Kingdom.

  - Any reference to a citizen of the EU or a national of the EEA includes a United Kingdom national as defined by the withdrawal agreement.

- These should also be read in light of any additional modifications mentioned in section 1B(3)(f) of the EUWA.

  - If an appointed representative outsources insurance distribution or home finance mediation activities, GEN 4.3.1 R does not apply to the processor if the principal ensures compliance as if the processor were the appointed representative.

- Fees for funds are based on the estimated costs to the FCA for assessing applications and notifications. The fee level varies depending on the Act's provision under which it is made and is adjusted for umbrella schemes.

- Application fees for recognized bodies are calculated using a tariff structure reflecting the estimated processing cost for that type and complexity of application.

- Fees for applications and notifications under the Payment Services Regulations are detailed in FEES 3 Annex 8R. The fee depends on the type of payment services a firm wants to provide and whether it will be a small or authorized payment institution, and the number of agents it has.

- Fees under the Electronic Money Regulations are in FEES 3 Annex 10 R, depending on whether the firm is an authorized or small electronic money institution.

PRA-authorized persons may also pay regulatory transaction fees to the PRA as set out in Chapter 4 of the Fees Part of the PRA Rulebook.

### Method of payment

- The appropriate authorization or registration fee is part of an application for, or a variation of, a Part 4A permission or other permissions under various regulations. Any application or notification received without the full fee will not be treated as made, and the FCA will contact the applicant to inform them that the application cannot proceed until the fee is received. <mark>If the fee is not forthcoming, the application will be returned.</mark>

## FEES 4A Temporary Permissions Regime (TPR) and Financial Service Contracts Regime (FSCR) – periodic fees

**Author's Note** - Section skipped.

From ChatGPT:

The **Temporary Permissions Regime (TPR)** and **Financial Services Contracts Regime (FSCR)** were introduced by the UK government and the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) in response to Brexit. They were designed to ensure that firms previously operating under EU passporting rights could continue servicing UK clients after the UK left the European Union.

### 1. **Temporary Permissions Regime (TPR)**  
The **TPR** allowed EEA-based firms and funds that were passporting into the UK before Brexit to continue operating while they sought full UK authorisation. This regime was meant to provide continuity and avoid disruption after the end of the Brexit transition period.

### 2. **Financial Services Contracts Regime (FSCR)**  
The **FSCR** applied to EEA firms that did **not** enter the TPR but still had **pre-existing contractual obligations** in the UK. It allowed them to wind down their UK operations in an orderly fashion, ensuring that they could continue servicing existing contracts but without taking on new business.

Both regimes came with **periodic fees** charged by the FCA to cover the cost of oversight and regulatory functions.

**Author's Note** - The handbook jumps to this section from GENPRU 3.1. so I assume it is all missing.

Skipped. This section is for insurers.

## MIFIDPRU Prudential sourcebook for MiFID Investment Firms

## MIFIDPRU 1.1 Application and Purpose

**IMPORTANT AUTHOR'S NOTE** - The MIFIDPRU section is aimed at companies with value at risk.

The firms within MIFIDPRU typically have some form of financial exposure, which could include:

- Market Risk - If the firm trades financial instruments on its own account (proprietary trading, market-making).
- Credit Risk - If it extends credit to clients or is exposed to counterparties.
- Operational Risk - If it holds client money/assets or relies on complex systems for execution.
- Liquidity Risk - If it needs to meet funding obligations but lacks immediate access to liquid assets.

For this reason, I will skip MIFIDPRU and come back to it later if I need to, keeping just this first section, below.

### Application

- **General Application**
  - <mark>MIFIDPRU doesn't have a single application rule. Each chapter or section has its own application statement.</mark>
  - Generally, MIFIDPRU applies to:
    1. MIFIDPRU investment firms
    2. UK parent entities
    3. Parent undertakings in an investment firm group based in the UK

- **Collective Portfolio Management Investment Firms**
  - These firms are included in the definition of a MIFIDPRU investment firm and must follow MIFIDPRU rules unless stated otherwise.
  - They are also subject to IPRU-INV 11 requirements and should refer to IPRU-INV 11.6 for guidance on how MIFIDPRU interacts with IPRU-INV 11.
  - Many MIFIDPRU requirements apply only to MiFID business, not to collective portfolio management activities, but some apply to the entire firm.

- **Application to Overseas Firms**
  - MIFIDPRU doesn't directly apply to firms not based in the UK. However, it imposes obligations on UK parent entities regarding third-country undertakings in the same group.
  - MIFIDPRU 2 provides more guidance on its application to investment firm groups.

- **Third Country MIFIDPRU Investment Firms**
  - The FCA generally won't authorize these firms unless they are subject to equivalent prudential regulation in their home country.
  - The FCA considers factors like regulatory outcomes, supervision, legal framework, and cooperation with overseas regulators.
  - If a third country firm isn't subject to equivalent regulation, it may need to establish a UK subsidiary to comply with MIFIDPRU.
  - Even if granted permission, these firms must comply with ongoing threshold conditions and Principles, including informing the FCA of relevant matters.

### Purpose

- **General Purpose**
  - <mark>MIFIDPRU outlines prudential requirements for MIFIDPRU investment firms, excluding designated investment firms regulated by the PRA.</mark>
  - <mark>It mainly covers MiFID business but some rules apply to the whole firm.</mark>

- **Expansion on Basic Requirements**
  - MIFIDPRU builds on basic requirements like maintaining adequate financial resources as per COND 2.4 and Principle 4.

### Tied Agents

- **Definition and Application**
  - Tied agents act on behalf of investment firms, promoting services, handling orders, placing instruments, or providing advice.
  - MIFIDPRU references to tied agents exclude appointed representatives not involved in MiFID business.
  - Firms' responsibilities for appointed representatives are relevant for their ICARA process under MIFIDPRU 7.

### Voluntary Application of Stricter Requirements

- **Holding More Funds or Stricter Measures**
  - Firms can hold more funds or apply stricter measures than required by MIFIDPRU.
  - Stricter measures must still meet MIFIDPRU's basic requirements.
  - Firms unsure about stricter measures should consult the FCA.

### Notifications and Applications Without Dedicated Forms

- **General Rule**
  - If a notification or application is required but no specific form is provided, firms must use forms in MIFIDPRU 1 Annex 5R or 6R and submit them online.

  - Definitions of ASA and CMH relate to MiFID business. Firms can hold client assets/money in other business and still be SNI if they have necessary permissions.

### Additional Provisions for Calculation

    1. Is a regulated activity.
    2. Is conducted from an office of the firm in the United Kingdom.
    3. Involves a client in the United Kingdom.

### Purpose

#### MAR 4.3 Support of the Takeover Panel's Functions

- **Compliance with the Takeover Code:**
  - A firm must not act, or continue to act, for any person in connection with a transaction to which the Takeover Code applies if the firm reasonably believes that the person, or their principal, is not complying or is unlikely to comply with the Takeover Code.

- **Takeover Panel notices:**
  1. The Takeover Panel issues notices about compliance with the Takeover Code and may name individuals it believes are unlikely to comply. These notices are available on the Takeover Panel's website.
  2. Firms should stay informed about these notices and consider them to comply with MAR 4.3.1 R. If a person is named in such a notice, the FCA expects firms to comply by not acting for that person.
  3. The FCA does not consider a firm in breach of MAR 4.3.1 R if the Takeover Panel allows the firm to act in relation to that transaction.

- **Restrictions under MAR 4.3.1 R:**
  1. When a restriction applies, the firm cannot engage in any designated investment business activity or approve any financial promotion related to a transaction under the Takeover Code.
  2. The firm can still perform other activities, including regulated activities, for that person, as long as they are not connected to a transaction under the Takeover Code.

- **Professional advice exceptions:**
  1. An authorised professional firm can still provide professional advice or representation in proceedings if it falls under section 327(8) of the Act. This includes legal advice from law firms and accounting advice from accounting firms.
  2. Although authorised professional firms have a duty to act in their clients' best interests, this duty does not override the Takeover Code's provisions.

- **Providing information to the Takeover Panel:**
  - A firm must provide any requested information and documents to the Takeover Panel to help it perform its functions, as well as any assistance the firm can reasonably provide.

- **Definition of "documents":**
  - In MAR 4.3.5 R, "documents" include information recorded in any form. For information not in legible form, providing documents means producing a legible copy.

- **Limitation on document requests:**
  - Due to section 413 of the Act, MAR 4.3.5 R does not require a firm to produce, disclose, or allow inspection of protected items.

### MAR 4.4 Exceptions

- **Exceptions to the chapter:**
  1. This chapter does not require an authorised professional firm to break any professional conduct rules or guidance notes applicable to its profession.
  2. It does not prevent an authorised professional firm from providing professional advice that:

## MAR 5A Organised trading facilities (OTFs)

**Author's Note** - The following is from Grok and explains OTFs.

ChatGPT:

An **OTF** (Organised Trading Facility) is a type of trading venue under European financial regulations, specifically designed for trading financial instruments that do not fit into the traditional exchange or multilateral trading facility (MTF) categories. OTFs are regulated by MiFID II (Markets in Financial Instruments Directive II) and provide a platform for trading instruments such as bonds, structured products, and derivatives.

Key characteristics of an OTF include:

- **Discretionary Order Execution**: Unlike traditional exchanges, firms operating OTFs can exercise discretion in the execution of client orders.
- **No Proprietary Trading**: An OTF operator is prohibited from executing client orders against its own capital unless specific conditions are met.
- **Separation from Systematic Internalisers**: OTFs must operate independently of systematic internalisers (SIs) to prevent conflicts of interest or order interaction between the two.

Essentially, an OTF is a regulated venue that allows for more flexible, less structured trading compared to an exchange, with a focus on giving discretion to the operator in matching client orders and executing trades.

## MAR 5A.1 Application

  - While not explicitly listed above, ensure your KYC/AML processes align with FCA's expectations under financial crime regulations.

- Decentralization and DAOs:

  - While not directly in the Handbook, consider consulting external FCA guidance or legal advice on the implications of using a DAO structure within a regulated activity.

### Specialist Sourcebooks That Might Apply (Depending on Structure) 

1. COLL – Collective Investment Schemes

  - If your platform structures invoice tokenization as a collective investment scheme (CIS)—where investors pool funds to buy invoice-backed tokens—this sourcebook could apply.
  - If tokens represent a fund structure rather than individual claims, FCA could classify the platform under CIS rules.
  - Key impact: Would require FCA authorization and compliance with fund management regulations.

2. CONC – Consumer Credit Sourcebook

  - If your platform provides credit or financing to businesses or consumers, it could fall under consumer credit regulation.
  - If invoices are sold with recourse or structured as lending, FCA may classify the platform as a credit provider.
  - Key impact: Would require FCA authorization as a consumer credit firm, triggering FSCS, FOS, and regulatory compliance requirements.

3. SECN – Securitisation Sourcebook

  - If your platform packages invoices into tradeable securities (rather than just selling them individually), it may fall under securitization regulations.
  - If invoice-backed tokens function similarly to asset-backed securities (ABS), this sourcebook might apply.
  - Key impact: Would require compliance with transparency, risk retention, and investor protection rules.

4. CTPS – Critical Third Parties Sourcebook

  - If your platform becomes systemically important for financial services firms (e.g., widely used for liquidity solutions), the FCA might classify it as a Critical Third Party (CTP).
  - Key impact: May require resilience, security, and governance compliance.

5. FUND – Investment Funds Sourcebook

  - If invoices are structured into a fund-like vehicle where investors pool capital, investment fund regulations could apply.
  - This is similar to COLL but applies more broadly to alternative investment funds (AIFs).
  - Key impact: FCA AIFM registration could be required if managing assets for investors.
