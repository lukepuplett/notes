## Types of Firms

### MiFID Optional Exemption Firm

A MiFID optional exemption firm is exempt from full MiFID and may include "Receiving and transmitting orders without holding client funds or securities". However, ZW may be seen as holding securities, unless perhaps this falls under the smart contract operator which is decentralised or a DAO or DUNA. Exemption may be provided if no retail customers are involved, only pros.

### Credit Institution

A credit institution accepts deposits, grants loans and credit for its own account, so e.g. banks and building societies.

### Notes

> Further, MiCA doesn't cover crypto-assets (or crypto-asset services) that are deemed to be securities in order to prevent a duplication of frameworks. These services around tokenized securities are covered by MiFID and for those who want to trial securities trading and settlement on blockchains, the EU adopted a "DLT pilot regime" that kicked-off officially in March 2023.

> There's this "prudential context" which seems to be a broader responsibility to the UK and the industry.

Additional observations:
- 'Fit and proper standards' are specified separately for PSR and EMR firms.
- Other businesses in the firm's group have an impact on adequacy of risk/controls/conduct.
- Conduct applies to world-wide activities, though depends on standards expected in location/market, duties to its regulator.
- Breaching a principle brings about liability to disciplinary sanctions.
- Onus on FCA to find fault, depending on the principle.
- A client can be treated as eligible counterparty which means they are sophisticated and can look after themselves.
- A retail customer can be a prospective customer, obviously.
