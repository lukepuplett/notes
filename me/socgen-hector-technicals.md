# Network Migration System - Technical Overview

## Project Context
During my time at a French bank, I developed a comprehensive system to migrate thousands of users from a legacy network system to Windows NT domains. The migration presented several critical challenges that required innovative technical solutions.

## Core Challenges

**Infrastructure Constraints**
- Complete machine reinstallation required
- Users had access to up to 12 mapped network drives, reducing to just 2 post-migration
- Zero downtime tolerance, especially for trading floor operations
- Weekend migration windows with full functionality required by Monday

**Excel Dependency Crisis**
- Bank-wide Excel usage with extensive inter-sheet linking
- Network path changes would break all existing spreadsheet links
- Hundreds of thousands of Excel files across the network

**Software Inventory Complexity**
- Over 2,000 applications requiring cataloging
- Multiple versions of the same software across departments
- Unknown software usage patterns and dependencies

## Technical Solutions

### Excel Link Management System
Developed a multi-machine processing system that:
- Scanned every cell in every Excel workbook across the network
- Stored link relationships in a comprehensive database
- Generated dependency graphs showing file interconnections
- Created tree views so complex they took an hour to fully expand
- Automatically repaired broken links after migration
- Ran for weeks during analysis phase, then days during repair phase

### Intelligent Software Auditing Agent
Created a Visual Basic application with multiple modules:

**Data Collection Component**
- Registry key analysis for installed software detection
- Complete hard disk file enumeration
- Network drive mapping and accessibility analysis
- User environment profiling

**Machine Learning Classification System**
- Self-developed scoring algorithm (without formal ML training)
- Weighted scoring based on multiple evidence types:
  - File system evidence (executables, configuration files)
  - Registry evidence (installation keys, version information)
  - User context (department, desk number, IP address)
- Confidence-based decision making (90% threshold for auto-classification)
- Continuous learning from support engineer feedback
- Evolved from manual classification to near-complete automation

### Migration Management Workbench
Built a comprehensive Visual Basic application featuring:

**Software Repackaging Tracker**
- Managed 2,000+ application repackaging tasks
- Tracked consultant team progress and blockers
- Priority management and resource allocation
- Notes system for technical issues and dependencies

**Permission Architecture Designer**
Implemented a French team-invented access control methodology:
- Automated Windows NT account creation
- Intelligent group membership assignment
- File placement optimization for minimal drive mapping
- Maintained user access while reducing network complexity

**Department Readiness Reporting**
- Excel-integrated pivot table system
- Color-coded status indicators (green = ready for rollout)
- Drill-down capability for bottleneck identification
- Real-time prioritization support for blocking issues

## Technical Architecture Highlights

**Scalability Solutions**
- Multi-machine parallel processing for Excel analysis
- Database-driven dependency tracking
- Modular application design for different workflow stages

**Intelligence Features**
- Adaptive learning algorithms improving accuracy over time
- Context-aware software identification
- Automated decision making with human oversight fallback

**Integration Capabilities**
- Excel plugin for reporting and analysis
- Database connectivity for centralized data management
- Cross-module data sharing within the workbench application

## Project Impact
Successfully enabled the migration of thousands of users with zero business disruption, maintaining full functionality for critical trading floor operations while dramatically simplifying the network infrastructure from 12+ mapped drives to 2 per user.
