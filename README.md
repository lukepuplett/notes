# My Public Notes

These are notes that I've taken when reading documentation or watching technical webcasts. When learning something new I like to write some of the docs up again in more simple terms. Doing this helps me condense wordy documentation and I tend to discover things I don't understand when trying to rewrite a thing.

They are a moment in time and will age badly. I do not keep them up to date. I post them here for myself and on the off-chance someone else might find them useful.
