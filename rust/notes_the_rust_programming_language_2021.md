Here are your reformatted notes with technical jargon and programming terms enclosed in backticks:

- `cargo` is the build system and package manager
- `cargo` is a command-line executable tool
- Command `cargo new hello_cargo` creates a new project using:
  - `Cargo.toml`
  - `src/main.rs`
  - Also initializes a new Git repo with a `.gitignore` file
- `TOML` stands for Tom's Obvious Minimal Language
- It looks like a Windows `.ini` file but with comments
- `cargo` is the build system and package manager
- `cargo` is a command-line executable tool
- `cargo new hello_cargo` creates a new project using:
  - `Cargo.toml`
  - `src/main.rs`
  - Also initializes a new Git repo with a `.gitignore` file
- `TOML` stands for Tom's Obvious Minimal Language
  - Looks like a Windows `.ini` file but with comments
- Packages are called crates
- Use `cargo build` for more verbose output and chunk files in `/target/debug/hello_cargo` folder
- `cargo run` will build and run
- `cargo check` is like `tsc --noEmit` command, a fast way to check for compilation errors
- `cargo build --release` to build an optimized proper release binary
- Chapter 2
- Rust has a standard set of items it brings into scope of each program, called the Prelude
- Function names ending with an exclamation mark are actually macro calls
- By default, variables are immutable
- `mut` keyword makes a variable mutable (like `let` versus `const` in JavaScript)
- `String::new()` makes a new UTF-8 encoded string
- Can call into library using longer syntax: `std::io::stdin`
- Use `use std::io;`
- The `stdin()` function returns an instance of `std::io::Stdin`
- `io::stdin().read_line(&mut guess)`
  - `&` denotes a reference
  - `mut` denotes mutability of the reference
- `.expect("Failed to read line");`
- The `read_line` method returns a `Result` enum that can be one of many state variants, `Ok` or `Err` in this case
- `expect` is a method on the `Result`
- `expect` is used to catch and throw expected errors
- If `Ok`, `expect` returns the value that `Ok` is holding (in this case, the number of bytes read)
- If you don't call `expect`, the compiler will warn you about unused results
- String interpolation is like C#, except it seems to only take a variable name in the curly brackets
- Must use empty curly brackets for positional placeholders and then supply the expression after the string
- Example: `println!("x = {}, y + 2 = {}", x, y + 2);`
- `Cargo.lock` locks in versions until you specifically update, and this file should be checked into git
- `cargo update` will ignore the lock file and look for latest versions while adhering to semver in `Cargo.toml` file
- Once the dependency is downloaded, just use `rand::Rng;`
- Page 23
- `cargo doc --open` CLI command will build docs for all dependencies
- `match` keyword performs a pattern match and has arms like cases in C#
- `let guess: u32 = guess.trim().parse().expect("Please type a number!");`
- Looks like a variable can be converted in-situ; this is called shadowing
- An `expect` style call can be converted to use `match`:
  ```rust
  let guess: u32 = match guess.trim().parse() {
      Ok(num) => num,
      Err(_) => continue,
  };
  ```
- Chapter 3: Common Programming Concepts
- `const` can be declared in any scope, must be annotated with its type, and use shouting caps
- Using the `let` keyword can shadow an existing variable. Shadows are locally scoped
- Four scalar types: integers, floating-points, booleans, characters
- Integer sizing: 8, 16, 32, 64, and 128 bits. Can use underscore in literals like in JavaScript, e.g., `1_000`
- Overflows will panic in debug mode, wrap in release mode
- Can use `wrapping_*`, `checked_*`, `overflowing_*`, and `saturating_*` type methods to get specific behaviors
- Integer literals can be:
  - `98_222`
  - `0xff` for hex
  - `0o77` for octal
  - `0b1111_0000` for binary
  - `b'A'` for a byte
- Two types of floating-point: `f32` and `f64` (default, same speed as `f32`)
- Character literals use single quotes: `'z'` or `'ğŸ˜»'`
- Compound types: tuples and arrays
- Tuple example: `let tup: (i32, f64, u8) = (500, 6.4, 1);`
- Destructuring syntax: `let (x, y, z) = tup;` and `let five_hundred = tup.0;`
- A tuple with no values `()` is called a unit and represents an empty return value
- Arrays are of a fixed type and length: `let a = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];`
- Arrays are allocated on the stack. Use a `Vec` (vector) from the standard library for elastic sets
- Define: `let a: [i32; 5] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];`
- Also: `let a = [3; 5];` has five elements all set to 3
- `let first = a[0];`
- `usize` means `u32` or `u64`, depending on the platform architecture
- Rust uses snake_case for function names
- `let y = { let x = 3; x + 1 }` works as long as there's no final semicolon, which would cause it to become a statement and not an expression that returns a value
- `fn() -> i32 { }` uses the arrow to denote a return type
- `if number < 5 { ... } else { ... }` No brackets around conditions in Rust, and it also uses the `else if` syntax
- `let number = if something { 5 } else { 6 };`
- `let result = loop { ... break counter * 2; };` The break from the loop can return a value
- `'some_name: loop { ... break 'some_name; }` In this syntax, the loop has a name or label called `'some_name`
- `while some_condition { ... }` This is like C#
- `for element in ... { ... }` This syntax is for-each style
- `for number in (1..4).rev() { ... }` This syntax demonstrates a for-each over a group of numbers where the numbers have been reversed
Chapter 4: Understanding Ownership
- Each value has an owner
- There can only be one owner at a time
- When the owner goes out of scope, the value will be dropped
Page 62:
- Rust calls `drop` as soon as a value goes out of scope
- `let s1 = String::from("hello");`
  `let s2 = s1;`
  The assignment in `s2` copies the pointer on the stack, but not the heap object value itself
- `s1` becomes invalid and cannot be used again
- In Rust, this is known as a move
- Types annotated with the `Copy` trait will be copied
- Types with the `Drop` trait cannot also be annotated with `Copy`
- The scalar types all implement `Copy`
- Passing a value to a function will move or copy
Page 70:
- To return a value from a function, just express it without the semicolon
- Rust concept of references, which allow a function to borrow. Example: `fn(s: &String)`
- The opposite of `&` referencing is `*` dereferencing (Chapter 15 and Chapter 8)
- We're not allowed to mutate borrowed references
- Instead, we must make a mutable reference: `&mut s`
- Example: `change(&mut s)`
- Change the method signature to take a mutable reference: `fn change(some_string: &mut String) { ... }`
- Cannot have multiple references to the same value at the same time or same scope
- The scope of a reference ends on its last use, so you can define a mutable reference after that last usage
- Cannot create dangling references where the underlying value has been dropped while a reference is still pointing at it
- A slice is like a reference, has common range syntax: `[7..16]`, `[7..]`, `[..]`
- String slices must begin and end at UTF-8 character boundaries
- The string slice is a first-class type with symbol `&str`
- Benefit: a string slice is bound to its underlying memory
- A string literal (e.g., `"hello"`) is a string slice and `&str`
- Use `&str` in function signatures, e.g., `fn first_word(s: &str) { ... }`
Chapter 5: Using Structs to Structure Related Data
- `struct User { active: bool, username: String, ... }`
- `let user1 = User { active: true, ... }` Note that it uses colons to set values, but uses dot notation to access fields, e.g., `user1.active`
- The entire instance is mutable, and Rust has no access modifiers
- Can use field init shorthand, e.g., `User { username, email, ... }` where the name of the variable/argument matches the name of the field
- Struct update syntax makes a new instance using values from an existing instance: `let user2 = User { active: false, ..user1 }`
- But the values are moved, and `user1` values can no longer be used
- Tuple structs seem to be tuples but with a name, which makes them different types
- Can define unit-like structs, which have no fields. This appears to be like a flag interface or trait in Rust parlance
- The book explains why the `username` field is `String` and not `&str`: it's so that the `User` struct owns the value, as opposed to being lent the data
- A struct can store references, but it needs a lifetime specified
Page 94:
- The book does a detour on printing a struct for debugging via `println!`, which means perhaps implementing a trait called `Debug` by adding an attribute to the struct: `#[derive(Debug)] struct Rectangle { ... }`
- It mentions that the `dbg!` macro will take ownership of a value and print it along with the file and line number to standard error, not standard out
- `dbg!(30 * scale)` will work because `dbg!` hands back the value
I apologize for the omissions. You're right, I should have included more of the code examples you provided. Let me try again with a more comprehensive transcription of your notes:
- Chapter 6: Enums and Pattern Matching
- Similar to C# enums, but with key differences
- Basic enum syntax:
  ```rust
  enum IpAddrKind {
    V4,
    V6
  }
  ```
- Accessing enum variants: `IpAddrKind::V6`

- Rust enums can hold data:
  ```rust
  enum IpAddr {
    V4(String),
    V6(String)
  }
  ```
- Example usage:
  ```rust
  let home = IpAddr::V4(String::from("127.0.0.1"));
  ```

- Enums can hold tuples:
  ```rust
  enum IpAddr {
    V4(u8, u8, u8, u8),
    // ...
  }
  ```

- Enums can contain structs:
  ```rust
  enum IpAddr {
    V4(Ipv4Address),
    // ...
  }
  ```

- Enums can include other enums
- Enums can be quite complex, resembling structs
- Different variants can have different data types
- All variants are of the same enum type, allowing them to be passed as a single parameter to functions
- Methods can be defined for enums using `impl`

- Rust uses `Option<T>` instead of null:
  ```rust
  enum Option<T> {
    None,
    Some(T)
  }
  ```

- `match` expression for pattern matching:
  ```rust
  match coin {
    Coin::Penny => 1,
    Coin::Nickel => 5,
    // ...
  }
  ```
- Match arms can include multi-line code blocks
- Can extract values from enums using binding patterns:
  ```rust
  match coin {
    // ...
    Coin::Quarter(state) => {
      // use the state variable
    }
  }
  ```

- Match arms must cover all possibilities
- Example of matching raw values with a catch-all pattern:
  ```rust
  match dice_roll {
    6 => celebrate(),
    other => move_player(other)
  }
  ```
- Underscore `_` pattern for ignoring values
- Combine `_` with unit `()` for no-op:
  ```rust
  match dice_roll {
    6 => celebrate(),
    _ => ()
  }
  ```

- `if let` syntax for matching a single outcome:
  ```rust
  if let Some(v) = some_value {
    // ...
  }
  ```
- Chapter 7: Managing Growing Projects with Packages, Crates, and Modules

- Package: Can contain multiple binary crates and optionally one library crate
  - Similar to Visual Studio solution
  - Contains a `Cargo.toml` file
  - Used to build, test, and share crates

- Crate: A tree of modules producing a library or executable
  - Smallest amount of code Rust compiler considers at a time
  - Can be a single .rs file compiled by `rustc` command-line utility

- Module: Controls organization, scope, and privacy of paths

- Path: Way of naming items (struct, function, module)

- Crate root: Source file where Rust compiler starts (root module)

- Package structure:
  - `src/main.rs`: Convention for binary crate root
  - `src/lib.rs`: Convention for library crate root
  - Can have both, resulting in two crates

- Module declaration:
  ```rust
  mod name {
    // Inline code
  }
  ```
  Or in separate files:
  - `src/name.rs`
  - `src/name/mod.rs` (old way)

- Privacy:
  - Module code is private by default
  - Use `pub mod` to make module public
  - Use `pub` for items within the module

- `use` keyword: Similar to C#'s `using`, but can import specific types

- Module referencing:
  - Relative path syntax
  - `self` syntax
  - `super` syntax
  - Identifier

- Sub-modules can use code from ancestor modules, but not vice versa

- Rust API Guidelines: https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/

- Packages with bin and lib:
  - Define module tree in `lib.rs`
  - Keep bin lightweight

- Idiomatic to bring types into scope via full path
  - Use parent module path for naming collisions:
    ```rust
    fmt::Result
    ```

- Aliasing with `as` keyword

- Re-exporting with `pub use`:
  - Allows modules to present different public structure
