# EIP-6900 - Modular Smart Contract Accounts

https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6900

Requires EIP-165, EIP-1271, EIP-4337

 - Standardize Smart Contract Accounts (SCA) and composable account modules.

 - MSCA is a Modular SCA.

 - Emphasis on secure permissioning of modules and max-interop.

 - Proposes a standard that coordinates the implementation work between module developers and account developers.

 - Defines an MSCA capable of supporting all standard-conformant modules.

 - Three types of modular functions; Validation, Execution and Hooks.

 - Validation hooks run before a validation function and can enforce permissions. Execution hooks can run before or after an execution function.

 - A Native Function is one implemented by the modular account, not one added by a module.

 - A Module is a deployed contract that hosts the above three kinds of functions.

 - A module's Manifest defines the execution functions, interface IDs and hooks to install on the account.

 - The standard supports calls from the ERC-4337 EntryPoint, or direct calls from EOAs and other external contracts.

 - The spec has some good diagrams which describe the call stack for an EntryPoint and EOA/SC. The stack runs down through layers.

 - The class EOA/SC flow runs down through 'Pre-runtime Validation Hook(s)' > 'Runtime Validation Function' > 'Pre-execution Hook(s)' > 'Native Function or (Module) Execution Function' > 'Post Execution Hook(s)'.

 - The EntryPoint calls down through the 'Pre-UserOp Validation Hook(s)' to the 'UserOp Validation Function' and then again from the EntryPoint the execution flow runs down through 'Pre-execution Hook(s)' > 'Native Function or (Module) Execution Function' > 'Post-execution Hook(s)'.

 - Modular account MUST implement:

   - IAccount.sol and IAccountExecutable.sol from ERC-4337.
   - IERC6900Account.sol to support management and usage, and account identification.
   - The function `isValidSignature` from ERC-1271.

 - Modular accounts MAY implement:

   - IERC6900AccountView.sol to support visibility in account states on-chain.
   - ERC-165

 - Modules MUST implement:

   - IERC6900Module.sol with ERC-165.

 - Modules MAY implement any of:

   - IERC6900ValidationModule, IERC6900ValidationHookModule, IERC6900ExecutionModule, IERC6900ExecutionHookModule.

 - The spec defines a whole slew of interfaces and the proposal seems centered around these interfaces as become de-facto.

## IERC6900Account.sol

Purpose: Core interface for modular accounts to manage execution and module installation/uninstallation.

#### Types

 - `ModuleEntity`
 - `ValidationConfig`
 - `ValidationFlags`
 - `HookConfig`

#### Structs

 - `Call`

#### Events

 - `ExecutionInstalled`
 - `ExecutionUninstalled`
 - `ValidationInstalled`
 - `ValidationUninstalled`

#### Functions

 - `execute`
 - `executeBatch`
 - `executeWithRuntimeValidation`
 - `installExecution`
 - `uninstallExecution`
  -`installValidation`
 - `uninstallValidation`
 - `accountId`

Flavor: This is the backbone of an MSCA, handling execution (single or batch calls), runtime validation, and the plugging/unplugging of execution and validation modules. It’s all about flexibility and control over what the account can do post-deployment.

## IERC6900AccountView.sol

Purpose: Optional interface for inspecting module configurations on a modular account.

#### Structs

 - `ExecutionDataView`
 - `ValidationDataView`

#### Functions

 - `getExecutionData`
 - `getValidationData`

Flavor: A read-only lens into how the account is wired—lets you peek at execution and validation setups, including hooks and flags. Think transparency and debugging.

## IERC6900Module.sol

Purpose: Base interface all modules must implement for lifecycle management and identification.

#### Functions

 - `onInstall`
 - `onUninstall`
 - `moduleId`

Flavor: The minimum handshake for any module—how it gets set up, torn down, and identified. It’s the foundation for pluggability.

## IERC6900ValidationModule.sol

Purpose: Optional interface for modules providing validation logic (e.g., for user ops, runtime, or signatures).

#### Functions

 - `onInstall` (inherited)
 - `onUninstall` (inherited)
 - `moduleId` (inherited)
 - `validateUserOp`
 - `validateRuntime`
 - `validateSignature`

Flavor: This is about gatekeeping—deciding who or what can interact with the account, whether via user operations, direct calls, or signed messages. It’s the security layer of modularity.

## IERC6900ValidationHookModule.sol

Purpose: Optional interface for modules adding pre-validation hooks to enhance validation logic.

#### Functions

 - `onInstall` (inherited)
 - `onUninstall` (inherited)
 - `moduleId` (inherited)
 - `preUserOpValidationHook`
 - `preRuntimeValidationHook`
 - `preSignatureValidationHook`

Flavor: Hooks that run before validation kicks in—think of them as pre-flight checks for user ops, runtime calls, or signature verifications. Adds extra layers of control or customization.

## IERC6900ExecutionModule.sol

Purpose: Optional interface for modules providing executable functions for the account.

#### Structs

 - `ManifestExecutionFunction`
 - `ManifestExecutionHook`
 - `ExecutionManifest`

#### Functions

 - `onInstall` (inherited)
 - `onUninstall` (inherited)
 - `moduleId` (inherited)
 - `executionManifest`

Flavor: Defines what the account can do—the actual actions it can take. The manifest is like a blueprint of its capabilities, making it pluggable and self-describing.

## IERC6900ExecutionHookModule.sol

Purpose: Optional interface for modules adding pre/post hooks around execution functions.

#### Functions

 - `onInstall` (inherited)
 - `onUninstall` (inherited)
 - `moduleId` (inherited)
 - `preExecutionHook`
 - `postExecutionHook`

Flavor: Wraps execution with before-and-after logic—great for logging, checks, or cleanup. It’s the execution’s sidekick, enhancing what happens when the account acts.

## Summary of Flavors

 - `IERC6900Account`: The central hub—executes calls and manages module plug-ins.
 - `IERC6900AccountView`: The inspector—shows you what’s plugged in and how.
 - `IERC6900Module`: The base plug—any module’s entry ticket.
 - `IERC6900ValidationModule`: The gatekeeper—controls access and permissions.
 - `IERC6900ValidationHookModule`: The pre-checker—adds validation guardrails.
 - `IERC6900ExecutionModule`: The doer—defines the account’s actions.
 - `IERC6900ExecutionHookModule`: The enhancer—tweaks execution with hooks.

Together, these interfaces create a system where functionality (execution) and security (validation) can be swapped in and out post-deployment, with hooks for fine-tuning. It’s a Lego set for smart accounts, balancing flexibility and structure.

 - The spec defines mandatory and advised behaviours for implementers.

 ## Validation Call Flow

  - Support for three call flows for validation; UserOp, runtime and signature validation. UserOp validation is the implementation of ERC-4337 `IAccount.validateUserOp`. Runtime validation happens via the 'dispatcher' function `executeWithRuntimeValidation` or when using 'direct call validation'. Signature validation is the account's implementation of `isValidSignature` from ERC-1271.

 - For each type, an implementation MAY choose its own 'format' for selecting which validation function to use, as well as any per-hook data for validation hoks. I have no clue what this means.

 - Validation functions MUST check that the provided validation function applies to the given function selector, see 'Checking Validation Applicability', then it MUST run all relevant validation hooks, then it MUST invoke the right validation function. Any revert, reverts and includes the module's revert data.

 - "The account MUST define a way to pass data separately for each validation hook and the validation function itself. This data SHOULD be sent as the `userOp.signature` field for user op validation, the `authorization` field for runtime validation, and the `signature` field for signature validation." I have no clue what that means.

Giving up here, I have no idea what's it's talking about now.
