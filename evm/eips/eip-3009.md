# EIP-3009 - Transfer With Authorization
## A contract interface that enabled transferring of fungible assets via a signed authorization.

https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3009

## Problem

 - Sequential nonces can lead to transaction failures due to nonce collisions or ordering issues.

 - The ERC-20 `approve`/`transferFrom` ("ERC-20 allowance") pattern is susceptible to the [multiple withdrawal attack](https://blockchain-projects.readthedocs.io/multiple_withdrawal.html)/[SWC-114](https://swcregistry.io/docs/SWC-114), and encourages antipatterns such as the use of the "infinite" allowance.

## Solution

 - Random 32-byte nonces are used to prevent nonce collisions.

 - Signed authorizations to enable "meta-transactions" where users can sign-off on transfers, allowing others to pay for gas or batch transactions atomically.

 - Time-bound validity, so transactions can be scheduled or have an expiry.

 - EIP-712 signatures.

## Specification

Here's a breakdown of the main and optional components found in the EIP-3009 contract specification.

The arguments `v`, `r`, and `s` must be obtained using the EIP-712 typed message signing spec.

### Main Contract Members, Events, Constants, and Functions:

#### Constants:

```solidity
TRANSFER_WITH_AUTHORIZATION_TYPEHASH: A constant bytes32 hash for the TransferWithAuthorization typed message.
RECEIVE_WITH_AUTHORIZATION_TYPEHASH: A constant bytes32 hash for the ReceiveWithAuthorization typed message.
```

#### Events:

```solidity
AuthorizationUsed: Emitted when an authorization is used with parameters authorizer and nonce.
```

#### Functions:

```solidity
authorizationState(address authorizer, bytes32 nonce): Checks if a given nonce has been used for an authorizer.
transferWithAuthorization(address from, address to, uint256 value, uint256 validAfter, uint256 validBefore, bytes32 nonce, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s): Executes a transfer with the provided signed authorization.
receiveWithAuthorization(address from, address to, uint256 value, uint256 validAfter, uint256 validBefore, bytes32 nonce, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s): Allows receiving a transfer with authorization, with an additional check that the caller is the payee.
```

### Optional Contract Members, Events, Constants, and Functions:

#### Constants:

```solidity
CANCEL_AUTHORIZATION_TYPEHASH: A constant bytes32 hash for the CancelAuthorization typed message.
```

#### Events:

```solidity
AuthorizationCanceled: Emitted when an authorization is canceled, with parameters authorizer and nonce.
```

#### Functions:

```solidity
cancelAuthorization(address authorizer, bytes32 nonce, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s): Allows canceling an authorization, preventing it from being used.
```

These optional elements provide additional functionality for managing authorizations, specifically the ability to cancel them, which can be useful for enhancing security or correcting errors in authorizations before they are acted upon.

### Examples

#### Domain Separator 

```Solidity
DomainSeparator := Keccak256(ABIEncode(
  Keccak256(
    "EIP712Domain(string name,string version,uint256 chainId,address verifyingContract)"
  ),
  Keccak256("USD Coin"),                      // name
  Keccak256("2"),                             // version
  1,                                          // chainId
  0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48  // verifyingContract
))
```

 - "With the domain separator, the typehash, which is used to identify the type of the EIP-712 message being used, and the values of the parameters, you are able to derive a Keccak-256 hash digest which can then be signed using the token holder's private key."

 - That makes no sense, so I got Claude to try and explain it and it produced this:

```Solidity
// First, the domain separator (from above)
DomainSeparator := Keccak256(ABIEncode(
    Keccak256(
        "EIP712Domain(string name,string version,uint256 chainId,address verifyingContract)"
    ),
    Keccak256("USD Coin"),                      // name
    Keccak256("2"),                             // version
    1,                                          // chainId
    0xa0b86991c6218b36c1d19d4a2e9eb0ce3606eb48  // verifyingContract
))

// The typehash for a transfer (from EIP-3009)
TRANSFER_WITH_AUTHORIZATION_TYPEHASH := Keccak256(
    "TransferWithAuthorization(address from,address to,uint256 value,uint256 validAfter,uint256 validBefore,bytes32 nonce)"
)

// Then to create the final digest that gets signed, you combine:
// 1. "\x19\x01" (EIP-712 version byte + version 1)
// 2. The domain separator
// 3. The hash of the actual data using the typehash
digest := Keccak256(
    "\x19\x01",
    DomainSeparator,
    Keccak256(ABIEncode(
        TRANSFER_WITH_AUTHORIZATION_TYPEHASH,
        from,
        to,
        value,
        validAfter,
        validBefore,
        nonce
    ))
)
```

 - **Note** - I don't know how Claude knows to put the type hash before the from parameter.

#### Something

 - The author can't be bothered to explain what this does.

 - I think it's the computation of the type hashes for the various functions.

 - I don't even know what language this is.

```Solidity
// Transfer With Authorization
TypeHash := Keccak256(
  "TransferWithAuthorization(address from,address to,uint256 value,uint256 validAfter,uint256 validBefore,bytes32 nonce)"
)
Params := { From, To, Value, ValidAfter, ValidBefore, Nonce }

// ReceiveWithAuthorization
TypeHash := Keccak256(
  "ReceiveWithAuthorization(address from,address to,uint256 value,uint256 validAfter,uint256 validBefore,bytes32 nonce)"
)
Params := { From, To, Value, ValidAfter, ValidBefore, Nonce }

// CancelAuthorization
TypeHash := Keccak256(
  "CancelAuthorization(address authorizer,bytes32 nonce)"
)
Params := { Authorizer, Nonce }
```

There's a break and then some more code.

```Solidity
// "‖" denotes concatenation.
Digest := Keecak256(
  0x1901 ‖ DomainSeparator ‖ Keccak256(ABIEncode(TypeHash, Params...))
)

{ v, r, s } := Sign(Digest, PrivateKey)
```

 - "Smart contract functions that wrap receiveWithAuthorization call may choose to reduce the number of arguments by accepting the full ABI-encoded set of arguments for the receiveWithAuthorization call as a single argument of the type bytes."

 - This text comes after the code above. That code seems to relate to computing type hashes, but it's left to the reader to work out what it's for. I think the text above doesn't relate to computing type hashes or signing.

 - The author then has some more code which I think shows how to "wrap" the `receiveWithAuthorization` call in a function that accepts a single argument of type `bytes`, as above.

```Solidity
// keccak256("receiveWithAuthorization(address,address,uint256,uint256,uint256,bytes32,uint8,bytes32,bytes32)")[0:4]
bytes4 private constant _RECEIVE_WITH_AUTHORIZATION_SELECTOR = 0xef55bec6;

function deposit(address token, bytes calldata receiveAuthorization)
    external
    nonReentrant
{
    (address from, address to, uint256 amount) = abi.decode(
        receiveAuthorization[0:96],
        (address, address, uint256)
    );
    require(to == address(this), "Recipient is not this contract");

    (bool success, ) = token.call(
        abi.encodePacked(
            _RECEIVE_WITH_AUTHORIZATION_SELECTOR,
            receiveAuthorization
        )
    );
    require(success, "Failed to transfer tokens");

    // ...
}
```

#### Use via Web3 Providers

 - The signature for an authorization can be obtained using a web3 provider with the `eth_signTypedData{_v4}` method.

 - Presumably JavaScript:

```JavaScript
const data = {
  types: {
    EIP712Domain: [
      { name: "name", type: "string" },
      { name: "version", type: "string" },
      { name: "chainId", type: "uint256" },
      { name: "verifyingContract", type: "address" },
    ],
    TransferWithAuthorization: [
      { name: "from", type: "address" },
      { name: "to", type: "address" },
      { name: "value", type: "uint256" },
      { name: "validAfter", type: "uint256" },
      { name: "validBefore", type: "uint256" },
      { name: "nonce", type: "bytes32" },
    ],
  },
  domain: {
    name: tokenName,
    version: tokenVersion,
    chainId: selectedChainId,
    verifyingContract: tokenAddress,
  },
  primaryType: "TransferWithAuthorization",
  message: {
    from: userAddress,
    to: recipientAddress,
    value: amountBN.toString(10),
    validAfter: 0,
    validBefore: Math.floor(Date.now() / 1000) + 3600, // Valid for an hour
    nonce: Web3.utils.randomHex(32),
  },
};

const signature = await ethereum.request({
  method: "eth_signTypedData_v4",
  params: [userAddress, JSON.stringify(data)],
});

const v = "0x" + signature.slice(130, 132);
const r = signature.slice(0, 66);
const s = "0x" + signature.slice(66, 130);
```

## Rationale

 - The author explains in detail why sequential nonces do not actually help achieve transaction ordering for meta transactions in practice.

 - Explains that valid-after and valid-before are good when using "relayers" which are dapps and services that relay transactions for users.

 - Justifies the use of EIP-712 signatures.

 ## Backwards Compatibility

 - "In order to add support for EIP-3009 to existing contracts ("parent contract") that use the ERC-20 allowance pattern, a forwarding contract ("forwarder") can be constructed that takes an authorization and does the following:

 - Extract the user and deposit amount from the authorization
 - Call receiveWithAuthorization to transfer specified funds from the user to the forwarder
 - Approve the parent contract to spend funds from the forwarder
 - Call the method on the parent contract that spends the allowance set from the forwarder
 - Transfer the ownership of any resulting tokens back to the user

 - **Note** - Due to the author's ambiguous use of invented terms "parent contract" and "forwarder", I'm not sure what this is actually saying.

 - The author then includes some sample code but it has no context and because of the ambigous stuff above, I don't know what it's for and have excluded it.

 ## Test Cases

 - There's some very helpful Solidity for several contracts involved in implementing EIP-3009.

 - The following repo has a fully working example:

 https://github.com/CoinbaseStablecoin/eip-3009/blob/master/contracts/lib/EIP3009.sol

 ## Security Considerations

 - "Use `receiveWithAuthorization` instead of `transferWithAuthorization` when calling from other smart contracts."

 - Presumably the above is a "MUST".

 - An attacker watching the mempool could extract the transfer authorization and front-run the `transferWithAuthorization` call to execute the transfer without invoking the wrapper function. This could potentially result in unprocessed, locked up deposits.

 - The author then goes on to explain how `receiveWithAuthorization` prevents this by performing an additional check that ensures that the caller is the payee.

 - "If there are multiple contract functions accepting receive authorizations, the app developer could dedicate some leading bytes of the nonce could as the identifier to prevent cross-use."

 - No idea what the above point means.

 - When submitting many transfers in quick succession, keep in mind that relayers and miners decide the processing order. For transactions that are dependent on each other, it is recommended that the signed authorizations are submitted one at a time.

 - Because the built-in `ecrecover` returns the zero address when a malformed signature is provided, the zero address MUST be rejected when using `ecrecover` to prevent unauthorized transfers and approvals of funds from the zero address.

# My Notes on Permit and Permit 2

**Note** - I don't think Uniswap's Permit2 implements either EIP-2612 or EIP-3009.

## Permit2 vs Permit1 Comparison

### Permit1 (EIP-2612)
- Is an extension to ERC-20 tokens
- Requires token contracts to implement the permit interface
- Only works with compatible tokens (e.g., USDC)
- Each token needs its own implementation

### Permit2 (Uniswap)
- Is a standalone contract that works with any ERC-20
- Users approve the Permit2 contract once
- Permit2 then manages all future token approvals
- Two approval modes:
  1. AllowanceTransfer: Traditional allowances with added features
  2. SignatureTransfer: Permit-style using off-chain signatures

### Key Benefits of Permit2
- Universal compatibility with all ERC-20 tokens
- Single approval for all protocols using Permit2
- More granular control over approvals
- Built-in expiration mechanics
- Widely audited and adopted in DeFi
- Reduces maximum approval security risks

### Integration
- Growing adoption in DeFi protocols
- Recommended for new protocols due to better security model
