| CREATE2 | An Ethereum opcode that allows the deployment of contracts with a deterministic address based on the sender's address, the contract's bytecode, and a salt. |
| ERC-1271 | An Ethereum standard that defines a method (isValidSignature) for contracts to verify signatures. Useful for smart contract wallets and multi-signature wallets. |
| ERC-712 | An Ethereum standard for typed structured data hashing and signing, often used to ensure the validity and security of data being signed. |
| magicBytes | A specific sequence of bytes (0x6492649264926492649264926492649264926492649264926492649264926492) used to identify wrapped signatures meant for predeploy contract verification. |

## Abstract

 - Problem: ERC-1271 can’t verify signatures if the contract isn’t deployed yet.
 - Solution: ERC-6492 proposes a standard to verify signatures for contracts before deployment.
 - Extension: Uses a new format extending ERC-1271 to enable predeploy signature verification.
 - Magic Bytes: Special bytes (0x6492...) identify these special signatures.

## Motivation

 - Account Abstraction: Delaying contract deployment until the first transaction improves user experience.
 - dApps Requirement: Many dApps need signatures for actions like logging in, even before contract deployment.
 - Current Limitation: ERC-1271 can’t handle signatures from non-deployed contracts.
 - Solution Benefit: Allows contract wallets to sign messages before deployment, enhancing functionality and user interaction.

## Specification

### Signer Side

 - Deployed Contract:
    
   - If the contract is already deployed, produce a standard ERC-1271 signature.
        
 - Not Deployed:
    
   - If the contract is not yet deployed, create a wrapped signature.
        
   - The wrapped signature format: concat(abi.encode((create2Factory, factoryCalldata, originalERC1271Signature), (address, bytes, bytes)), magicBytes).
        
   - create2Factory and factoryCalldata provide the data needed to deploy the contract.
        
   - The magicBytes (0x6492649264926492649264926492649264926492649264926492649264926492) at the end identify the signature as a special predeploy type.
        
 - Deployed but Not Ready:
    
   - If the contract is deployed but not yet ready to verify signatures, wrap the signature with preparation data.
        
   - The format: concat(abi.encode((prepareTo, prepareData, originalERC1271Signature), (address, bytes, bytes)), magicBytes).
        
   - prepareTo and prepareData include the necessary transactions to prepare the contract for signature verification.
    
### Verifier Side

 - Magic Bytes Check:
    
   - First, check if the signature ends with the specific magicBytes.
        
   - If detected, proceed to deploy the contract using the provided deployment data.
        
 - Contract Deployment:
    
   - Perform a deployment by calling the factory contract with factoryCalldata.
        
   - Deploy the contract if it’s not already deployed.
        
 - ERC-1271 Verification:
    
   - Check if there is contract code at the address.
        
   - If code exists, perform the standard ERC-1271 verification by invoking isValidSignature on the contract.
        
 - Retry with Preparation Data:
    
   - If ERC-1271 verification fails and the contract is deployed but not yet ready, retry using prepareData.
        
 - Fallback to ecrecover:
    
   - If no contract code exists at the address, use ecrecover to verify the signature as a regular externally owned account (EOA) signature.
        
 - Verification Order:
    
   - Check for magicBytes first to handle counterfactual signatures.
        
   - If magicBytes are found, deploy the contract and verify.
        
   - If the contract is already deployed, verify using ERC-1271.
        
   - Finally, fall back to ecrecover if necessary.

## Rationale

 - Clean Implementation:
    
   - Wrapping the signature with deployment data is a straightforward and contract-agnostic method.
        
   - Allows passing deployment information without needing specific contract details.
    
 - Collision Avoidance:
    
   - The magicBytes end with 0x92, which is not a valid value for the v parameter in ECDSA signatures, avoiding conflicts.
        
   - The length of magicBytes (32 bytes) ensures it doesn’t collide with normal ERC-1271 signatures.
    
 - Verification Order:
    
   - Magic Bytes First:
        
            § Ensures counterfactual signatures are valid after deployment.
        
   - ERC-1271 Before ecrecover:
        
            § Prevents mistakenly verifying a contract signature as an EOA signature.
        
   - Retry Mechanism:
        
            § Handles cases where the contract was signed before deployment or isn’t ready for verification yet.
    
 - Handling Pre-deploy Signatures:
    
   - The wrapper format with deployment data allows contracts to be deployed and signatures verified correctly.
        
   - Ensures that even if the contract is deployed later, the signature remains valid and verifiable.
    
 - Backward Compatibility:
    
   - The proposal integrates seamlessly with existing standards (ERC-1271), enhancing them without causing disruptions.
        
   - Supports all signature types, including EOAs and typed data (EIP-712).

## Backwards Compatibility

 - ERC-1271 Compatibility:
    
   - Extends the existing ERC-1271 standard without altering its core functionality.
        
   - Ensures contracts that implement ERC-1271 can still verify signatures as usual.
        
 - Supports Existing Signatures:
    
   - Can validate both new counterfactual signatures and traditional signatures.
        
   - Works with externally owned account (EOA) signatures and contract-based signatures.
        
 - Non-Disruptive:
    
   - Existing systems and dApps using ERC-1271 do not require modifications to support this new proposal.
        
   - The additional logic for predeploy verification is additive, not substitutive.
        
 - Flexible Integration:
    
   - The wrapper format and magic bytes are optional and designed to be easily recognized.
        
   - Allows developers to adopt the new standard without impacting current implementations.
        
 - Enhances Functionality:
    
   - Provides a robust method to handle signatures from contracts that are yet to be deployed, addressing a limitation of ERC-1271.
        
   - Ensures a seamless user experience by enabling interaction with dApps even before contract deployment.

 - These components together create a flexible and secure system for validating signatures, including those from contracts that are yet to be deployed, addressing the limitations of the current ERC-1271 standard.

Security Considerations

 - Reentrancy Concerns:
    
   - Contract deployment in isValidSigWithSideEffects may introduce reentrancy risk.
        
   - Mitigated by reverting if side effects occur and capturing the actual result from the revert data.
    
 - Off-chain Validation:
    
   - Validate signatures off-chain to avoid gas costs and potential security risks associated with on-chain execution.
    
 - Contract Permissions:
    
   - Ensure contracts have correct permissions set up at deployment to enable meaningful signature verification.
    
 - Signature Replay Protection:
    
   - Implement mechanisms to prevent replay attacks, particularly important for off-chain signature validation.
    
 - Counterfactual Signatures:
    
   - Consider the possibility of validating a signature that becomes invalid due to changes in authorized keys or contract state.
    
 - Deployment Safety:
    
   - Contracts should be deployed with caution, ensuring proper testing and auditing to prevent security vulnerabilities.
    
    These considerations are essential for maintaining the security and integrity of the signature validation process in the Ethereum ecosystem.
