# ERC-2612 - Permit Extension for EIP-20 Signed Approvals
## EIP 20 approvals via EIP 712 secp256k1 signatures

Also known as the "permit" extension for EIP-20.

https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612

 - 

## Problem

 - A user allowing a contract to spend their tokens must make an initial transaction to the token contract's `approve` function to set the allowance, then a second transaction to the contract to spend the tokens.

 - This is confusing, costly, frictionful. Users may approve a large allowance to avoid the need to approve repeatedly.

## Solution

 - Allow users to sign a message offchain to approve a contract to spend their tokens using EIP-712 secp256k1 signatures.

 - This EIP proposes extending EIP-20 with a `permit` function.

 - Allows users to "modify the `allowance` mapping using a signed message, instead of through `msg.sender`".

## Key Interfaces

```Solidity
function permit(address owner, address spender, uint value, uint deadline, uint8 v, bytes32 r, bytes32 s) external
function nonces(address owner) external view returns (uint)
function DOMAIN_SEPARATOR() external view returns (bytes32)
```

## Semantics

 - For all addresses `owner`, `spender`, uint256s `value`, `deadline` and `nonce`, uint8 `v`, bytes32 `r` and `s`,

 - A call to `permit(owner, spender, value, deadline, v, r, s)` will set `allowance[owner][spender]` to `value`, increment `nonces[owner]` by 1, and emit a corresponding `Approval` event, if and only if the following conditions are met:

 - The current blocktime is less than or equal to `deadline`.

 - `owner` is not the zero address.

 - `nonces[owner]` (before the state update) is equal to `nonce`.

 - `r`, `s` and `v` is a valid `secp256k1` signature from `owner` of the message:

 - If any of these conditions are not met, the `permit` call must revert.

## Message

 - The proposal is the usual EIP shitpost and suddenly details the EIP-712 message.

```Solidity
keccak256(abi.encodePacked(
   hex"1901",
   DOMAIN_SEPARATOR,
   keccak256(abi.encode(
            keccak256("Permit(address owner,address spender,uint256 value,uint256 nonce,uint256 deadline)"),
            owner,
            spender,
            value,
            nonce,
            deadline))
))
```

 - This is the message that is signed by the user to approve the contract to spend their tokens.

 - `DOMAIN_SEPARATOR` is defined according to EIP-712. The `DOMAIN_SEPARATOR` should be unique to the contract and chain to prevent replay attacks from other domains, and satisfy the requirements of EIP-712, but is otherwise unconstrained.

 - A common choice for `DOMAIN_SEPARATOR` is:

```Solidity
DOMAIN_SEPARATOR = keccak256(
    abi.encode(
        keccak256('EIP712Domain(string name,string version,uint256 chainId,address verifyingContract)'),
        keccak256(bytes(name)),
        keccak256(bytes(version)),
        chainid,
        address(this)
));
```

 - The proposal then details the EIP-712 typed structure using JSON.

 - The caller of the `permit` function can be any address.

 - It's expected that "relayers" (dapps and services) will obtain and submit a `Permit` on behalf of the `owner`.

 - The `owner` can limit the time a `Permit` is valid for by setting `deadline` to a value in the near future.

 - The `deadline` argument can be set to `uint(-1)` to create `Permit`s that effectively never expire.

## Security Considerations

 - MUST ensure `owner != address(0)` because `ecrecover` will return the zero address for any malformed message.

 - SHOULD use the `deadline` parameter to limit the duration of a `Permit` to a reasonable timeframe; a relayer might hold on to a `Permit` and submit it at a later time.

 - If the signing party holds ETH they can always submit the `Permit` themselves, which can render previously signed `Permit`s invalid.

 - The race condition for approvals (SWC-114) applies to `permit` as well.

 - If the `DOMAIN_SEPARATOR` contains the `chainId` and is defined at contract deployment instead of reconstructed for every signature, there is a risk of possible replay attacks between chains in the event of a future chain split.

# My Notes on Permit and Permit 2

**Note** - I don't think Uniswap's Permit2 implements either EIP-2612 or EIP-3009.

## Permit2 vs Permit1 Comparison

### Permit1 (EIP-2612)
- Is an extension to ERC-20 tokens
- Requires token contracts to implement the permit interface
- Only works with compatible tokens (e.g., USDC)
- Each token needs its own implementation

### Permit2 (Uniswap)
- Is a standalone contract that works with any ERC-20
- Users approve the Permit2 contract once
- Permit2 then manages all future token approvals
- Two approval modes:
  1. AllowanceTransfer: Traditional allowances with added features
  2. SignatureTransfer: Permit-style using off-chain signatures

### Key Benefits of Permit2
- Universal compatibility with all ERC-20 tokens
- Single approval for all protocols using Permit2
- More granular control over approvals
- Built-in expiration mechanics
- Widely audited and adopted in DeFi
- Reduces maximum approval security risks

### Integration
- Growing adoption in DeFi protocols
- Recommended for new protocols due to better security model
