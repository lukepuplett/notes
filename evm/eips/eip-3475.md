# ERC-3475 - Abstract Storage Bonds
## Interface for creating tokenized obligations with abstract on-chain metadata storage

https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-3475

Requires EIP-20, EIP-721 and EIP-1155

 - Issuing bonds with multiple redemption data cannot be acheived with existing token standards.

 - Allows the creation of tokenized obligations with abstract onchain metadata storage.

 - Enables each bond class ID to represent a new configurable token type where bond nonces represent issuing conditions or other data in `uint256`.

 - Bonds can be batched for issuance/redemption conditions for gas efficiency and UX.

 - Bonds can be divided and exchanged in a secondary market.

 - Current Liquidity Provider tokens are very simple ERC-20s. For complex reward and redemption logic stored onchain, we need a token that:

   - Supports multi token IDs.
   - Can store onchain metadata.
   - Doesn't require a fixed storage pattern.
   - Gas efficient.

 - This standard allows the creation of any obligation with the same interface, allowing any wallets and exchanges to read token balance and redemption conditions.

 - Can be batched as tradeable instruments, divided and exchanged in secondary markets.

## Samples

The following is the main interface for the standard with comments removed.

## Metadata

Metadata for a class or nonce is stored as an array of JSON objects with these key values.

*Note* - At this point it gets confusing and the quality becomes low with sloppy whitespace and typos. Very strange how so many EIPs seem to have been written by such overtly careless people. It makes it very hard to take any of the ideas seriously. Who reviews these? Why do they have such low standards?!

### Description

*Note* - I can't make sense of this. It's like a child has written it. Or someone trying to think and type while standing on a hot plate.

### I give up

It's horrendous.
