# ERC-7702 - Transaction Precondition Predicates for EOAs

[Link to EIP-7702](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-7702)

**Conceptual Summary**: ERC-7702 enables transaction precondition predicates that execute under EOA impersonation. In plain terms, it lets an Externally Owned Account (EOA) attach validation logic—like spending limits or multisig checks—to a transaction, running this logic in the EOA’s context (as if the EOA were a smart contract) before the transaction’s main action (e.g., a transfer) proceeds.

**Requires**: 
- EIP-1559 (for modern gas pricing, assumed in transaction format).
- EIP-2718 (Typed Transaction Envelope, to define the new transaction type).
- No other EIPs are strict dependencies, but aligns with EIP-4337 (Account Abstraction) for synergy.

## Official Explainer

**EIP-7702**, authored by Vitalik Buterin and others, introduces a new Ethereum transaction type that enhances Externally Owned Accounts (EOAs) with programmable validation, a step toward native account abstraction. It allows an EOA to specify precondition predicates—custom logic executed in the EVM—before a transaction’s payload (e.g., ETH transfer or contract call) is processed. This logic runs in the context of the EOA’s address (`msg.sender` is the EOA), enabling smart contract-like behavior without deploying a persistent contract.

### How It Works
- **New Transaction Type**: Defined under EIP-2718, ERC-7702 transactions include standard fields (`chainId`, `nonce`, `to`, `value`, `data`, etc.) plus an `authorization_list`.
- **Authorization List**: A list of `Authorization` objects, each containing:
  - `contract_code` (optional): Bytecode to execute as the EOA’s logic for this transaction.
  - `authority`: Address of a contract to call for validation (alternative to `contract_code`).
  - `parameters`: Calldata to invoke the validation logic (e.g., calling a `validate` function).
- **Execution Flow**:
  1. For each `Authorization` in the `authorization_list`:
     - If `contract_code` is provided, the EVM executes it as if it were the EOA’s code, with `msg.sender` as the EOA’s address.
     - If `authority` is used, the EVM calls the contract with `parameters` (e.g., `validate(address,bytes,uint256)`).
     - The validation must return `true` (0x01) for the transaction to proceed; otherwise, it reverts.
  2. If all validations pass, the EVM executes the main transaction (`to`, `value`, `data`).
- **No Persistent State**: Unlike deploying a contract, ERC-7702’s logic is transient—valid only for that transaction, leaving the EOA unchanged.

### Key Facts
- **Backward Compatibility**: Existing EOAs can use ERC-7702 without migration, as it’s opt-in via the transaction type. Regular transactions (e.g., EIP-1559) are unaffected.
- **Replaces EIP-3074**: ERC-7702 supersedes EIP-3074, which allowed EOAs to delegate to invoker contracts but had security flaws (e.g., replay risks). ERC-7702’s per-transaction logic is safer and more flexible.
- **Use Cases**: Enables gasless transactions (via paymasters), batched calls (e.g., approve + swap), custom permissions (e.g., daily limits), and multisig-like security, all natively for EOAs.

## Notes
- **Relation to Pectra**: ERC-7702 is part of the Pectra hard fork (2025), requiring EVM changes to process the new transaction type.
- **Security**: Validation contracts must be audited, as bugs could allow unauthorized actions. The boolean return (`true`) ensures clear validation.
- **Synergy with Standards**: Works with ERC-4337 (bundlers) and ERC-5792 (batched calls), enhancing wallet UX (e.g., MetaMask’s “Gator” framework).

**Nuance on “Impersonation”**: The term “impersonation” in the summary suggests the EOA pretends to be something else, but technically, the validation runs with the EOA as `msg.sender`. A more precise phrasing might be “in the EOA’s context,” though the original captures the intent for quick understanding.
