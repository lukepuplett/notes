# ERC-1822 - Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard (UUPS)

https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1822

 - A standard for proxy contracts that's universally compatible with all contracts.

 - Uses a unique storage "position" in the proxy contract to store the address of the "logic" contract.

 - Unlimited upgrades.

 - Proposes a method for selecting from multiple constructors.

 - The proxy contract proposed in the EIP should be deployed as is, along with the proxiable base contract which works with it.

 - The proxy contract has a single fallback function, like other proxy contracts from OZ and Gnosis.

 - To eliminate the possibility of collisions between data stored by the proxy contract and its implementing logic contract, the address of the logic contract is written to the storage position `keccak256("PROXIABLE")` which is 0xc5f16…

 - The proposed constructor accepts any number of arguments of any type, making it good for any logic contract constructor.

 - The nature of the constructor design means callers can select from one or more constructor functions available in the logic contract.

 - Important - if multiple constructors are included in logic, then add code to check and prevent it being called again.

 - The multi-constructor functionality does not inhibit verification of the proxy contract bytecode. The initialization transaction call data (input) can be decoded first via the proxy contract ABI and then via the logic contract ABI.

 - The proxy constructor take bytes and an address; the bytes of the data to pass to the address of the logic contract.

`contractLogic.delegatecall(data)`

 - The proxiable contract forms part of the logic contract (base class, likely).

 - Proxiable has two or three functions, it's hard to tell, `proxiable(?)`, `updateCodeAddress(…)`, `proxiableUUID(…)`.

 - The `proxiable(??)` which doesn't have any sample code in the spec, checks that a contract can become a logic contract, i.e. that it complies with the UUPS (this standard). Presumably it takes an address and returns a boolean and is designed to prevent bricking a contract by upgrading it with a bad logic contract.

 - It's a typically sloppy piece of writing. The reference `updateCodeAddress(address newAddress)` function instantiates the address as a new Proxiable and calls its `proxiableUUID()` function which just returns the static 0xc5 address as bytes32, presumably as a magic value/Shibboleth, and if all is good then it sets the logic contract address permanently.

 - Pitfalls when using a proxy:

 - Separate variables from logic. When designing a new version of the logic contract, care must be taken to prevent incompatibility with the existing storage of the proxy contract after an upgrade. The order in which variables are instantiated must be kept the same with any new variables instantiated afterwards. To make this easier, it's recommended to stick all your variables in a special base contract for this purpose.

 - Restrict dangerous functions. EIP references the "parity wallet hack" which sounds like the logic contract was "damaged". It says to restrict potentially damaging functions with owner checks, but to assign the owner to an effectively null address, like address(1). Damaging functions are things like `SELFDESTRUCT` and calls to external code like `delegatecall`.

 - There's an odd example where the owner is set during construction. It's odd because the owner is declared and initialized to address(1) not zero. It also sets the owner to msg.sender and has a function to upgrade the logic which runs an owner check (before calling the internal `updateCodeAddress()` function in the base proxiable contract. This is strange because the recommendation above was to set the owner to address(1) but it sets it as the invoker of the constructor. Odd.

 - The sample/reference implementation code in the EIP is strange. The implementation/logic contract seems to be independently callable. In their example, it is an ERC-20 token, but I cannot see why this logic could not be called directly bypassing the proxy.

 - I created a StackEx question around this https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/161527/eip-1822-potential-vulnerabilities-in-a-proxiable-contract-example

 - The EIP discussion seems to cast doubt on some other aspects, including a problem with the anti-brick mechanism where a user upgrades the logic to point to another proxy, which is possible because the proxy will implement the `proxiableUUID` function.

    Based on the discussion, the main concerns raised by the community regarding EIP-1822: Universal Upgradeable Proxy Standard (UUPS) are:
    
    1. **Missing Initialization Mechanism**: One of the key concerns raised by Amxx is the lack of a mechanism to initialize the memory state of the proxy when the logic contract is updated. They pointed out that `updateCodeAddress` should not only update the targeted logic contract but also reset the memory state of the proxy and configure the new logic properly. This is crucial for scenarios like upgrading from a simple ownable contract to a multi-sig contract, where the permissions and state need to be set up correctly in a single transaction during the update.
    
    2. **Governance and Identity Management**: There were discussions around how UUPS could be used for identity management and governance. Amxx mentioned their objective is not generic upgradable contracts but identity proxies with upgradable governance. gbarros suggested that UUPS could serve as the smallest possible interface/base for an identity, which could then be extended with additional functionality related to identity abilities.
    
    3. **Compatibility with Existing Implementations**: Ali2251 raised concerns about the lack of novelty in UUPS compared to existing implementations like OpenZeppelin's proxy contracts or the Gnosis Safe contracts. They pointed out that UUPS seems similar to OpenZeppelin's Unstructured Storage pattern and questioned how it differs from existing solutions.
    
    4. **Standardization and Developer Experience**: The authors of UUPS (pi0neerpat and gbarros) emphasized the importance of creating a standard proxy interface to improve developer experience across the ecosystem. They argued that having a standardized approach would make the process more accessible and avoid fragmented and incompatible implementations.
    
    5. **Storage Slot Choice**: Ali2251 noted that the Gnosis Safe contracts do not use the first storage slot, as suggested in UUPS, but instead use a different approach. The UUPS authors justified their choice of using the "Proxiable" storage slot as a way to standardize the process.
    
    Overall, the main concerns revolved around missing features like initialization mechanisms, compatibility with existing solutions, and the potential application of UUPS for identity management and governance. The discussion also highlighted the need for standardization and improving developer experience in the proxy contract ecosystem.
