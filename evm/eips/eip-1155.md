# ERC-1155 - Multi Token Standard

https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-1155

Requires EIP-165

 - Standard interface for contracts managing fungible or non-fungible token types.

 - Points out that ERC-721 NFTs have a single contract per token ID, supply and metadata, whereas ERC-1155 let's a single contract control many tokens each with their own metadata.

 - The functions of ERC-1155 take an `_id` parameter to distinguish the token.

 - Motivation cites games having to create thousands of token types, each with their own contract and code, resources, deployment.

 - Ability to transfer many token types at once, saving gas.

 - Nothing so far implies that ERC-1155 contracts need to implement ERC-20 or ERC-721, optionally or not.

 ```solidity
// Note: The ERC-165 identifier for this interface is 0xd9b67a26
interface ERC1155 /* is ERC165 */ {

    event TransferSingle(address indexed _operator, address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256 _id, uint256 _value);
    event TransferBatch(address indexed _operator, address indexed _from, address indexed _to, uint256[] _ids, uint256[] _values);
    event ApprovalForAll(address indexed _owner, address indexed _operator, bool _approved);
    event URI(string _value, uint256 indexed _id);

    function safeTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256 _id, uint256 _value, bytes calldata _data) external;

    function safeBatchTransferFrom(address _from, address _to, uint256[] calldata _ids, uint256[] calldata _values, bytes calldata _data) external;

    function balanceOf(address _owner, uint256 _id) external view returns (uint256);

    function balanceOfBatch(address[] calldata _owners, uint256[] calldata _ids) external view returns (uint256[] memory);

    function setApprovalForAll(address _operator, bool _approved) external;

    function isApprovedForAll(address _owner, address _operator) external view returns (bool);
}
```

 - The follow interface MUST be implemented by contracts wishing to be able to receive and hold tokens, along with ERC-165 interface enquiry.

```solidity
// Note: The ERC-165 identifier for this interface is 0x4e2312e0
interface ERC1155TokenReceiver {

    function onERC1155Received(address _operator, address _from, uint256 _id, uint256 _value, bytes calldata _data) external returns(bytes4);

    function onERC1155BatchReceived(address _operator, address _from, uint256[] calldata _ids, uint256[] calldata _values, bytes calldata _data) external returns(bytes4);       
}

 ```

## Safe Transfer Rules

 - Explicit rules for how `safeTransferFrom` and `safeBatchTransferFrom` operate with respect to the `ERC1155TokenReceiver` hook functions.

 - MUST not call "on receipt" hooks for non-contract recipients, only contracts.

 - MUST not call "on receipt" hooks for mints or transfers.

 - MUST revert if the receiver is not a receiver, i.e. does not implement `ERC1155TokenReceiver` UNLESS the tokens being sent are part of a hybrid implementation of another standard, then you MAY follow that standard's rules.

 - MUST revert if the receiver is a receiver but "returns an unknown value" ?! or throws and error.

 - Recipient is a receiver and "is the recipient of one and only one balance change" e.g. `safeTransferFrom` called:

   - MUST update balances before calling receiver hook.

   - MUST have emitted the transfer event before calling receiver hook.

   - MUST call one of `onERC1155Received` or `onERC1155BatchReceived` hooks and follow its rules.

 - Recipient is a receiver and "is the recipient of more than one balance change" e.g. `safeBatchTransferFrom`.

   - MUST update all balances before calling the hook.

   - MUST emit all transfer events before calling the hook.

   - MUST call recipient's `onERC1155Received` or `onERC1155BatchReceived` as many times as necessary to account for all balance changes
   
     - and the returned hook magic value MUST be checked and acted upon as per their rules.

   - SHOULD call the batch received hook and its rules MUST be followed.

   - MAY call the single received hook and its rules MUST be followed.

 - Creators of receiver contracts which forward received tokens in their hooks:

   - Forwarding should be considered acceptance, then `safeTransferFrom` or `safeBatchTransferFrom` is called in a new "context".

     - The acceptance magic value MUST be returned after forwarding is successful.
   
   - MAY re-purpose the `_data` argument for the new context.

   - MAY revert on failed forward; MAY keep retain ownership of the token(s) on failure.

 - When NOT using `safeTransferFrom` or `safeBatchTransferFrom` for a transfer, i.e. a non-standard API used, then:

   - Balance updates and events rules above still apply.

   - Hooks still need to be called and return values checked as above, however, while the `safeTransferFrom` or `safeBatchTransferFrom` must revert if the recipient is not an implemented receiver, a non-standard function MAY continue, see "Implementation-specific transfer API rules"

## Rules

 - `safeTransferFrom` rules:

   - MUST have pre-approval for the caller to manage the tokens being transferred out of the `_from` account, see Approval section.

   - MUST revert if `_to` is zero address.

   - MUST revert if balance of token `_id` holder is less than `_value`.

   - MUST revert on any other error.

   - MUST emit the `TransferSingle` event on balance change, see `TransferSingle` and `TransferBatch` rules.

   - MUST check if `_to` is a contract, and MUST call its hook with `_data` passed intact.

 - `safeBatchTransferFrom` rules:

   - MUST have pre-approval as above.

   - MUST revert on zero address as above.

   - MUST revert if `_ids.length != _values.length`.

   - MUST revert on any insufficient balances.

   - MUST revert on any error.

   - MUST emit `TransferSingle` or `TransferBatch`, see rules below.

   - MUST update balances and emit events in the order submitted in the array.

   - MUST check if `_to` is a contract and MUST call either hook with `_data` passed intact, see rules.

 - `TransferSingle` and `TransferBatch` event rules:

   - SHOULD emit `TransferSingle` for single transfers.

     - MAY emit it multiple times but `TransferBatch` is designed for gas efficiency.

     - MUST set `_operator` to a pre-approved address, SHOULD be `msg.sender`.

     - MUST set `_from`, `_to`, `_value` and `_id` (token type) to their obvious addresses, stupid to state this.

     - MUST set `_from` to `0x0` for mints, see rules.

     - MUST set `_to` to `0x0` for burning.

   - SHOULD emit `TransferBatch` for multiple balance transfers.

     - MAY emit it with a single element in the list for singles, though use the above.

     - Essentially there's the singular `_from` and `_to` addresses and a list of `_ids` and `_values` which correspond to each other and detail the tokens to transfer.

     - Otherwise, as above.

 - Clients and exchanges MAY use total value transferred from `0x0` minus total value sent to `0x0` on both transfer events to compute circulating supply for a token ID.

 - Implementers SHOULD emit `TransferSingle` from zero to zero, with the creator as `_operator` and `_value` `0` to announce the existence of the token.

 - Restates rule about emitting events before calling hooks.

 - `onERC1155Received` hook rules:

   - Most of it is either obvious, a restatement from what's been said already, or effectively usage documentation.

   - Recipients MAY accept an increase of its balance by returning the magic bytes below, but the transfer can still revert on other failures.
   
```
bytes4(keccak256("onERC1155Received(address,address,uint256,uint256,bytes)"))
```

   - Recipients MAY reject a transfer by calling `revert`, but any non-magic response MUST also cause a `revert` by the token contract.

   - All hook invocations represent "mutually exclusive" balance changes.

   - The set of all hook invocations via single or batch describes all balance changes during the transaction, in original listed order.

   - A contract MAY not call the hook if the transfer is to itself.

 - `onERC1155BatchReceived` hook rules:

   - Nothing further to add that's not obvious or beed said.

 - `ERC1155TokenReceiver` ERC-165 rules:

   - Implementation of ERC-165 looks like this:

```solidity
  function supportsInterface(bytes4 interfaceID) external view returns (bool) {
      return  interfaceID == 0x01ffc9a7 ||    // ERC-165 support (i.e. `bytes4(keccak256('supportsInterface(bytes4)'))`).
              interfaceID == 0x4e2312e0;      // ERC-1155 `ERC1155TokenReceiver` support (i.e. `bytes4(keccak256("onERC1155Received(address,address,uint256,uint256,bytes)")) ^ bytes4(keccak256("onERC1155BatchReceived(address,address,uint256[],uint256[],bytes)"))`).
  }
```

   - If you use your own code, it must indicate support for both ERC-165 and ERC-1155 and consume no more than 10,000 gas.

 - "Implementation-specific" transfer rules:

   - Implementation-specific means your own transfer function, not `safeTransferFrom`.

   - MUST still follow the rules for the normal methods for implemented receivers, but if the interface is not implemented then it SHOULD revert but MAY continue.

   - Example in spec gives a strange scenario in which a custom transfer is made to a contract address, but it returns a non-magic value and only then does it check if it is an implemented receiver, and if so, it MUST revert because it's certainly a rejection. Perhaps this design is more optimistic and gas efficient.

   - Notes that if the recipient is not a proper receiver, it can continue to transfer but tokens may be trapped.

   - Only non-standard transfer functions can choose to allow this, i.e. official transfer functions are strict.

 - Minting and burning rules:
