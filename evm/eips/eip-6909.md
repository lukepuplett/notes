# EIP-6909 - Minimal Multi-Token Interface
## A minimal specification for managing multiple tokens by their id in a single contract

https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-6909

Requires EIP-165

A simplified alternative to ERC-1155 Multi-Token Standard where callbacks and batching are removed and the permission system is a hybrid operator-approval scheme. The interface is reduced to bare minimum required to manage multiple tokens under the same contract.

Reminder: EIP-1155 is a standard inteface for contracts managing fungible or non-fungible tokens. Rather than having a contract per token, as with ERC-721, 1155 controls many tokens each with their own metadata with the use case being e.g. games needing many tokens.

## Motivation

 - 1155 has unnnecessary features like requiring recipient accounts with code to implement callbacks.

 - Single operator permission scheme grants unlimited allowance on every token ID in the contract.

 - Developer convenience methods like batch calls, increase/decrease allowance are omitted.

 - No opt-out from callbacks as in 721's `transferFrom` and `safeTransferFrom`, so recipient accounts with code (presumably Smart Accounts) enforced bloat to receive tokens.

 - Batching excluded to allow for opinionated batching designs to be layered on.

 - Support for granular allowances and full operators. 

## Specification

The interface ID is `0x0f632fb3`.

 - Definitions:
 
    - **infinite** - Max `uint256`
    - **caller** - Caller of current context, `msg.sender`
    - **spender** - Account transferring on behalf of another
    - **operator** - Account with unlimited transfer rights on all holdings of another
    - **mint** - Creation of an amount of tokens, MAY happen in a mint or as a transfer from the zero addr.
    - **burn** - Destruction of an amount, MAY happen in a burn or as a transfer to the zero addr.

### Methods

I've taken the documented functions and turned them into actual Solidity with comments using Grok AI.

```Solidity
/**
 * @dev Returns the amount of tokens of token type `id` owned by `owner`.
 * @param owner The address of the token owner.
 * @param id The token id to query the balance of.
 * @return amount The amount of tokens of type `id` owned by `owner`.
 */
function balanceOf(address owner, uint256 id) external view returns (uint256 amount) {}

/**
 * @dev Returns the amount of tokens of token type `id` that `spender` is allowed to transfer on behalf of `owner`.
 * @param owner The address which owns the tokens.
 * @param spender The address of the account that may transfer tokens.
 * @param id The token id to query the allowance of.
 * @return amount The amount of tokens of type `id` that `spender` is allowed to transfer.
 */
function allowance(address owner, address spender, uint256 id) external view returns (uint256 amount) {}

/**
 * @dev Checks if `spender` is an operator for `owner`.
 * @param owner The address which the operator status is checked for.
 * @param spender The address to check operator status.
 * @return status True if `spender` is approved as an operator for `owner`, false otherwise.
 */
function isOperator(address owner, address spender) external view returns (bool status) {}

/**
 * @dev Transfers `amount` tokens of token type `id` from the caller to `receiver`.
 * @param receiver The address to transfer tokens to.
 * @param id The token id to transfer.
 * @param amount The amount of tokens to transfer.
 * @return success True if the transfer was successful.
 */
function transfer(address receiver, uint256 id, uint256 amount) external returns (bool success)
{
    /**
     * MUST revert if the caller's balance for the token `id` is insufficient.
     * MUST log the `Transfer` event.
     * MUST return `true`.
     */
}

/**
 * @dev Transfers `amount` tokens of token type `id` from `sender` to `receiver` by the caller.
 * @param sender The address which owns the tokens to be transferred.
 * @param receiver The address to transfer tokens to.
 * @param id The token id to transfer.
 * @param amount The amount of tokens to transfer.
 * @return success True if the transfer was successful.
 */
function transferFrom(address sender, address receiver, uint256 id, uint256 amount) external returns (bool success)
{
    /**
     * MUST revert if the caller is neither the `sender` nor an operator for the `sender` and the caller's allowance for the token `id` for the `sender` is insufficient.
     * MUST revert if the `sender`'s balance for the token `id` is insufficient.
     * MUST log the `Transfer` event.
     * MUST decrease the caller's allowance by the same `amount` of the `sender`'s balance decrease if the caller is not an operator for the `sender` and the caller's allowance is not infinite.
     * SHOULD NOT decrease the caller's allowance for the token `id` for the `sender` if the allowance is infinite.
     * SHOULD NOT decrease the caller's allowance for the token `id` for the `sender` if the caller is an operator for the `sender`.
     * MUST return `true`.
     */
}

/**
 * @dev Sets the allowance for `spender` to transfer `amount` tokens of token type `id` on behalf of the caller.
 * @param spender The address which will spend the funds.
 * @param id The token id to approve.
 * @param amount The amount of tokens to approve.
 * @return success True if the approval was successful.
 */
function approve(address spender, uint256 id, uint256 amount) external returns (bool success) 
{
    /**
     * MUST set the allowance of a token `id` that a `spender` is permitted to transfer on behalf of the caller.
     * MUST set log the `Approval` event.
     * MUST return `true`.
     */
}

/**
 * @dev Sets or revokes operator permissions for `spender` to transfer any amount of any token on behalf of the caller.
 * @param spender The address to set as an operator.
 * @param approved True to grant operator status, false to revoke.
 * @return success True if the operation was successful.
 */
function setOperator(address spender, bool approved) external returns (bool success) 
{
    /**
     * MUST set the operator status to the `approved` value.
     * MUST log the `OperatorSet` event.
     * MUST return `true`.
}
```

### Events

Converted by Grok AI, as above.

```Solidity
/**
 * @dev The `caller` initiates a transfer of an `amount` of a token `id` from a `sender` to a `receiver`.
 * @param caller The address initiating the transfer (not indexed for gas savings).
 * @param sender The address from which the tokens are transferred (indexed for efficient filtering).
 * @param receiver The address to which the tokens are transferred (indexed for efficient filtering).
 * @param id The ID of the token transferred.
 * @param amount The amount of tokens transferred.
 * 
 * Note:
 * - When minting, `sender` is set to the zero address.
 * - When burning, `receiver` is set to the zero address.
 */
event Transfer(address caller, address indexed sender, address indexed receiver, uint256 indexed id, uint256 amount);

/**
 * @dev The `owner` has set the `approved` status to a `spender`.
 * @param owner The address setting the operator status (indexed for efficient filtering).
 * @param spender The address whose operator status is being set (indexed for efficient filtering).
 * @param approved The new operator status.
 * 
 * Note: 
 * - This event MAY logged even if the status doesn't change, for consistency.
 */
event OperatorSet(address indexed owner, address indexed spender, bool approved);

/**
 * @dev The `owner` has approved a `spender` to transfer an `amount` of a token `id` to be transferred on the ownerâ€™s behalf.
 * @param owner The address approving the transfer (indexed for efficient filtering).
 * @param spender The address approved to transfer tokens (indexed for efficient filtering).
 * @param id The ID of the token for which approval is given.
 * @param amount The amount of tokens approved for transfer.
 */
event Approval(address indexed owner, address indexed spender, uint256 indexed id, uint256 amount);
```

### Metadata Extensions

```Solidity
/**
 * @dev Returns the name of the token with the given `id`.
 * @param id The ID of the token to query the name for.
 * @return name The name of the token.
 */
function name(uint256 id) external view returns (string memory name) {}

/**
 * @dev Returns the symbol of the token with the given `id`.
 * @param id The ID of the token to query the symbol for.
 * @return symbol The symbol of the token.
 */
function symbol(uint256 id) external view returns (string memory symbol) {}

/**
 * @dev Returns the number of decimals for the token with the given `id`.
 * @param id The ID of the token to query the decimals for.
 * @return amount The number of decimals for the token.
 */
function decimals(uint256 id) external view returns (uint8 amount) {}
```

### Content URI Extension

```Solidity
/**
 * @dev Returns the URI for the contract's metadata.
 * @return uri The URI pointing to the contract's metadata.
 */
function contractURI() external view returns (string memory uri) {}

/**
 * @dev Returns the URI for the metadata of the token with the given `id`.
 * 
 * Note:
 * - MAY revert if the token id does not exist.
 * - The returned URI MUST replace occurrences of '{id}' with the actual token id when used by clients.
 *
 * @param id The ID of the token to query the URI for.
 * @return uri The URI pointing to the token's metadata.
 */
function tokenURI(uint256 id) external view returns (string memory uri) {}
```

**Note** - See the original EIP document for Metadata Structure JSON examples.

### Token Supply Extension

```Solidity
/**
 * @dev Returns the total supply of tokens for the given `id`.
 * @param id The token ID for which to query the total supply.
 * @return supply The total supply of tokens with the specified ID.
 */
function totalSupply(uint256 id) external view returns (uint256 supply) {}
```

## Rationale

 - Repeats stuff said above.

 - `safeTransfer` and `safeTransferFrom` naming is misleading, not used.

## Backwards Compat

 - Incompatible with 1155.

 - Wrappers for ERC-20, 721 and 1155 can be made.

## Reference Implementation

 - See original EIP.

## Security Considerations

 - Two considerations regarding delegating permission to transfer via allowance and operator features, the first is banal but the second is more interesting.

 - Unique to systems with both models, if an account has both operator permissions and an insufficient allowance for a given transfer, performing the allowance check before the operator check would result in a revert while performing the operator check before the allowance check would not. The specification intentionally leaves this unconstrained for cases where implementors may track allowances despite the operator status. Nonetheless, this is a notable consideration.

- I think this is saying, if a spender is an operator and has an allowance but that allowance is insufficient, the order of checks matters. The order is left up to the implementor.
