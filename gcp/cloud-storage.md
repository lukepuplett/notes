# Cloud Storage

## Concepts

### Key terms

All data belongs in a project.

#### Buckets

- Everything must be in a bucket.
- Data access based on buckets.
- There is no limits to the number of buckets you can have in a project or location.
- There are limits to the rate you can create or delete buckets.
- Buckets need a _globally_ unique name and location at creation, which are immutable.

#### Bucket labels

- These are key-value metadata that allow grouping with other GCP resources.
