# Dialogflow

Lifelike conversational AI with virtual agents.

**Note** - Google also have Contact Center AI, but I'm not sure how exactly it relates yet.

### Key features

- Visual flow builder - as it implies.
- Omnichannel implementation - does _not_ mention Slack or Teams.
- Advanced AI - uses BERT NLU.
- State-based data models - deviate from topic and return.
- End-to-end management - CI/CD, analytics, experiments and bot evaluation.
- For more, see Editions, below.
