# Prevailing Narratives of 2023

## Anti Woke

The woke movement that I would argue became truly massive in social consciousness with #metoo and Hollywood
sexual manipulation scandals and then BLM riots in USA is being pushed back on, hard.

This is also coming from some prominent investors and wealthy employers like Elon Musk. They seem to feel
that lefty values have gone too far. One meme shows a person who was "in the middle" is now on the right
because the left have pushed the left farther out, thus moving the middle to the left.

This quote captures what's going on quite nicely: _"Woke" is the latest word in the culture wars. But most Americans, including most independents, think it means aware of social injustices, not overly PC._ 

## Google Can't Ship Code

This is new for March 2023 and sprang from Microsoft's work with GPT AI company OpenAI and Bing, and then
got cemented by a viral blog post from an ex-Googler who said the company was fat and risk averse. It
sounded like it'd become a standard large enterprise to me.

This belief is being parroted by high profile Twitter accounts.

## Nuclear Power was Good Afterall

Nuclear energy was never a risk and we'd have been better off if we kept building them, and we should build
more today.

This is a power mimetic narrative that has grown on Twitter since it is a view supported by
very influential venture capitalists. The VCs are the modern day emporers as they're King and Queen-makers
so smart people need them to fund their businesses, and so those same smart people are unlikely to push
back on their thoughts. Other VCs also don't want to appear stupid, it seems, and can appear smarter by
agreeing with the richest VC.

The idea could be sound, I've no idea, but it is striking that this idea has arisen during:

- A time when the Ukraine conflict (home to Chernobyl) has shown that nuclear plants can be used like
hostages.
- A time when solar, wind and battery technology (and improved grids) looks like it could solve almost all
energy needs, negating the need for a new view of nuclear.

## Global Inflation

Post pandemic, there has been a surge in inflation. Two particularly interesting observations are:

- Each country views inflation as being its own doing, even though the inflation is a global phenomenon,
for example, in blaming political policy during the pandemic and the functioning of their domestic markets
and demographics.
- The most prominent pundit economists seem to have little interest in studying the fundamental causes,
nor the behaviour of the masses to understand the decision-making that's driving prices up. They instead
are reading history books and studying and discussing the inflation of the 70s and 80s which had nothing
to do with a global pandemic in the modern era of globalised markets.

## Artificial Intelligence and AGI

Superintelligence is coming sooner than we ever realised and we don't really know the ramifications of
this but it'll be like an alien lifeform landed.

The thinking is that whoever has this AGI, country or company or group, can weild enormous power. This
has led to a Chip War.

## Chip War and China was Bad Afterall

See above. USA has clamped down on the very leading edge technology being exported to China. The view is
that China have been stealing all their technological advancement from Western companies by mass producing
it in China.

## Reshoring and Friendshoring

See above. Companies are moving production from China and either back in domestic territory or to
nations currently viewed as friends. Some say this means higher inflation for longer. I think automation
will see low inflation for this decade.

Some think that this reshoring and de-globalisation narrative is overplayed.

## Crypto is Bad

This has been a narrative for years now and it still going. America is behind on regulation and seems to
be persecuting its crypto companies while many other countries are taking a more thoughtful approach.

## Bear Market

Most are negative on markets and economy and have been expecting a recession for months. However, the
reality seems to be that the economies of various major nations and zones are strong and keep suprising.

Just this last month has seen some positivity. Personally, it "feels" like the dark days are passed and
there's some optimism that The Federal Reserve is soon done raising rates, so markets will anticipate
this. Just my "feels", not my official opinion.

## Social Media was Bad Afterall

Some prominent investors now happy to say that certain social network products have led to a severe
decline in mental health, esp. in girls.
